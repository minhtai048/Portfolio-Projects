      "the game in general is the best ive ever played in terms of adventure fighting scenery events etc. the only thing id like to be changed is the space it takes to run. if we are unable to replay story quests and scenes it should be reasonable to have an option to delete those extra unused files to have more space. other than that best game out there.\n",
      "i absolutely love and adore this game. by far my favorite story roleplaying game out there. the quests lore plots mysteries grind pulls all of it. im a newer player but i havent been bored yet of this game. i dont think i ever will. id say its biggest issues is lagging and setting its quality different on its own. as well as occasional bugs on my laptop. if the frame per second fps could be a bit quicker that would be great. but other than that the game is beautiful. will update.\n",
      "it is amazing i have only been playing it for a few day it been lagging a lot might be becuse of my storage but all i need to say is its amazing the art style is amazing too 9 10 when you change to another app for even a second or keep it open in the background it just puts you back on the menu screen for a person who dose like 5 other things on their phone at the same time its a problem nothing truly bad to say. 9 10 love it\n",
      "this game is truly amazing and getting better day by day though it has many bugs and features that could be fixed for a better game experience. 1 my major issue is the storage this game is taking. im not sure if theres a fix for it but its getting out of hand and many mobile players are being forced to fully quit. 2 on mobile most times the chat will not open or glitch in coop which is annoying but it usually comes back after a few seconds. though its overall a great game i love it.\n",
      "the release of sumeru gave so much to do ive been playing for over a year. its got amazing graphics and tons of different characters to choose from. the story has got us anticipating more. although it is captivating it isnt really new player friendly. the new characters and weapons require items that new players cant have access to. it can cause them to rush through the story. other than that however the game has been treating us nicely. i hope the second year anniversary wont fail us.\n",
      "i really like playing genshin impact its really fun and i like exploring and building my characters. the only issues i have with the game is the lack of diversity and the lagging and how much time it takes for an update to get done. i try and play on my mobile phone but for the past few updates ive had to get rid of apps and clear my space on my phone because of how much space this one app takes. other then those issues all is good keep up the good work hoyoverse.\n",
      "great game the open world aspect is very well handled. leveling up in adventure rank is a chore but isnt that bad. best thing is that paying money to wish isnt required you can get new characters and progress through the game without spending anything and it isnt even pushed on you to spend money its just an option.\n",
      "the game is fun and surprisingly f2p friendly and good quality despite its reputation as a gacha game. but 2 issues 1 issue is that you can get a character affiliated with a state in a lvl 30 zone but can only progress to lvl 20 before needing items from the 30 zone to upgrade further. so if you get a character that isnt affiliated with lvl 1 29 you get screwed over. 2nd is that despite being a single player game requires a stable internet connection. afaik theres no way to go offline.\n",
      "definitely a great game thats made great strides compared to the first time i installed it. its still very laggy especially as the game includes more but its improved. its not very free to play friendly though. for the amount of characters coming out the spacing of events and primos possible make it very difficult to achieve getting characters. i experienced this in a major way as a beginner because of the large gap in what i wanted versus what was possible.\n",
      "the best mobile game i have ever played and ive played around 400 over the years. in terms of replayability daily drops animation combat characters genshin is totally unmatched by anything else. i also wanted to say that the weight of the characters feels good. jumps attacks flying it l feels natural. really good stuff i will continue to drop many hours and dollars for the privilege of playing.\n",
      "honestly genshin is everything im looking for in a game. a fantasy setting open world exploration and representation of real cultures characters beautiful art and graphics cool outfits and weapons co op quests events and music the developers have worked and are continuing to work really hard on satisfying players with constant updates. in my opinion you dont need to pay to make the experience fun. its amazing no matter what. \n",
      "lack of diversity i have been playing this game for almost 2 years daily. it has a good overall experience things to offer. however an issue thats been here from the start and has become more obvious with new releases is that it lacks diversity. skin tones body shapes weapon styles and more are very very lacking. we as a community have been saying this for almost 2 years yet get no response and are ignored or flagged. aside from these issues being problematic its just bad designing.\n",
      "would be a 5 star review if android had the option to use a controller. game is very expansive and you get a lot for free. wishes can be spendy cash wise but you get plenty of opportunities for free gear if you play consistently. graphics are great and run smooth. story is unique to me at least . gameplay is simple and effective. again if we could use controllers easy 5 star. accessibility is lacking because of this.\n",
      "the game is overall good. love the story so far where its going. my only complaints are the gacha system the visuals really. the game isnt f2p friendly at all the rates are kind of low it drains the wallet. while the view in the game is extraordinary the vastness of the game can deteriorate the quality of gaming. edit theres also definitely a lack in variety now when it comes to the characters. besides the new update theres little opportunity of new interesting team builds.\n",
      "yes this game is good with an interesting plot and lore. but the graphics are a little too extreme. yes i know this game is getting beautiful sceneries with a high set of graphics but i cant help but get a lag spike even when it says that the graphics are good to the point its smooth. that and the fact that sometimes after fighting enemies i find myself not being able to chat. either way a cool game with beautiful sceneries and amazing characters that have an interesting lore.\n",
      "updated review the game has pretty good quality music art va etc. updates that have been consistent for an entire year. the game is fairly easy to navigate and theres a decent amount of content for new players at this point of the game. however the bad part is its getting a bit taxing on your system the more updates they release so you might need a high end computer to run it.\n",
      "ive played more than my fair share of gacha games. genshin impact has improved on all of them with an open world thats interesting to explore. additionally theyve managed to avoid both the unnecessary powercreep usually seen in the genre as well as keeping the systems simple to understand and play while still rewarding mastery with fun gameplay. overall its well worth getting into.\n",
      "gameplay is great world is beautiful even with limited graphics and characters and their designs are amazing. however there are numerous problems. lack of content besides from limited events artifact grinding taking a copious amount of time etc. however the biggest problem for me right now is how often the servers disconnect. my wifi is fine ive changed it before and my phone ran it fine before. this issue makes the game almost unplayable and it happens way too often every 5 15 minutes \n",
      "amazing. i would like it if any time i minimized the game it didnt have to re connect and that you could unlock constellations instead of wishing. the main plot progresses slowwww and a lot of the quests are very monotonous and childish. other than that its a good game . ive spent a few real dollars playing and dont regret it.\n",
      "update 2.8 to 3.0 genshin couldnt be better of a game though i do wish there were more viable dps characters instead of the support types weve been getting as of late. i love the game. no problems. great storyline. amazing art. id love to learn from the artists. very happy with genshin. old keeps crashing after 2.5 update wont even get to the loading screen. have plenty of available ram and storage space. ive even tried uninstalling and reinstalling twice\n",
      "look the game is fun for the most part but this is twice now it has dumped my account after not letting me email verify. i was almost at level 26 this last time and it was really frustrating to log on and it start from the beginning. i am trying to verify to sync it so it doesnt happen a 3rd time and nothing happens when i hit send code. edit i am loving this game. the story is so involved and the puzzles can be quite tricky at times. i even have a few that are pinned for later.\n",
      "almost 2 years of scattered play. i always return for new content. the stories are fun and the game play is too. some of my friends started playing recently and they like it but its a lot to get through as far as reputation. i think mihoyo may need to come up with a faster route to get new players caught up with older players so old and new players can play fairly what i mean is i dont want to lower my world level and lose rewards or wait for my friends to get stronger for a few months.\n",
      "i love this game a lot. great story great gameplay all the characters have their own story and its super engaging. however the storage it takes is a little ridiculous. im being forced to quit because my phone cant handle it. its a really good game i hate to quit it just takes too much storage. hopefully a version for nintendo comes out.\n",
      "most games that have multiple platforms do not perform well when switching to a mobile device. im beyond impressed with this mobile version. while i still enjoy the control accuracy i get playing on my pc more if im away from home this is an awesome alternative. especially given the fact that its free with no ads.\n",
      "genshin impact keeps you entertained and unable to set your phone down. its interactive and provides multiple quests to go on. the graphics are aesthetically pleasing as well. only issue is the quick battery drain with long periods of playing. its to be expected though. definitely recommend this app when you want to kill some time.\n",
      "i love this game. even though sometimes i go on a break from it i still will always love it. the characters are interesting strong you have artifacts very good plot development and many many more reasons why i love this game. even if theres a few to many bugs id still play it to let the devs know about these bugs. the areas are also fun to explore as well. some people managed to get extremely strong characters that are underrated \n",
      "this game is mad fun. great characters gameplay world design its great. the music is absolutely bonkers good. i docked a star because there are some blaring issues that havent gone away. hoyoverse listens to the player base sometimes but some problems will probably never be fixed. these dont bother me i have lots of fun with this game as long as i dont make it a chore.\n",
      "rng is really bad in this game. fun but still no controller support for android despite all other platforms having it and it seems they intend on keeping it that way. the game itself runs worse with each update. ive had to turn graphics settings down just to keep the game playable every single time now due to updates. i think this game is comparable to games like craftopia. you could make your own fun in the beginning but it quickly gets boring.\n",
      "overall this game is amazing i originally played on my computer but it always lagged. i later downloaded it on my phone and ive had a few problems my amount of damage wont show everytime i go near water it glows at a certain angle distance and more. after asking other players on different platforms i found out that this isnt just a me problem but a problem for most of the android genshin players. id love to get any information to help with this problem or someone to fix it\n",
      "hey great game first off but im experiencing a bug recently the camera not one of the kameras. zoom seems to be inverted. zooming in is zooming out and zooming out is in. i looked in game settings but didnt see any settings that would invert the in game screengrab function... so help its mildly annoying but when youre wanting a nice shot especially in the event and it zooms out when youre wanting in its irritating. thank you for a great and enjoyable game \n",
      "nevertheless genshin is one of my favorite games of all time and its a really good game in general. 9 10 would recommend. edit also its alot of fun to play with friends and can lead to some really funny moment lol edit 8 24 22 the game is still super good and i love playing it but now i only really play it on my computer. it takes up to much storage and to help with the lag my full storage create ive turned down my graphics so its not as good anymore.\n",
      "the mobile version doesnt do this game justice its much less laggier on console and on a good pc. the graphics are amazing on those platforms the music is great and the story is great. however once you complete the story there is next to nothing to do and it gets repetitive very fast. its very difficult to earn primogems so in order to actually have a great experience with the game youre basically forced to spend money on it.\n",
      "edit until my android is able to use a controller with this game its no longer viable. difficulty ramps up and i cant keep up on touch controls. it was fun while it lasted. been playing this on phone and pc since release. this game is not just good. this is art this is a quality triple a game that can be played for zero dollars. for once i feel great supporting a game through an occasional microtransation. i pray this game goes for ages.\n",
      "superior cross play capabilities that are ahead of its time. i can get off the pc and play on my phone with very little to impact the gameplay. beautiful story and design and very little bugs game is 100 enjoyable ftp. only thing i can think of to improve is to add gamepad support for the android version i use a dual screen phone with programmable gamepad options but for those using products like the gamesir x2 are out of luck. this lack of support is my one star penalty.\n",
      "i took a hiatus from the game after the messy first anniversary. im more of a seasonal player now my goal is to do the events and gather lore. stellar art direction gameplay mechanics music environment story and characters. resin cap needs to be doubled 320 and cost should be halved 20 at the very least. as a result of the resin limitation artifacts still being heavily rng is extremely frustrating. events should be archived so players can view it again since theyre full of lore.\n",
      "i love this game and have been playing it for a while. but with this new update my game barely runs. barely any of the assets load in properly textures dont show amongst other things. i want to continue playing but im slowly beginning to struggle. ive spent hundreds on this game and made amazing memories on it and id hate to have to leave it.\n",
      "i love genshin ever since i downloaded it back in the end of march of 2022 but with the recent 2.8 update it keeps crashing on me and lagging bad time as in im just trying to do a single commission and it crashed on me twice in just an hour i play on mobile samsung s10e and my phone is completely up to date and ive never had any problems before so im just wondering if its just my phone or if its with everyone else. other then that i love this game and it got me addicted quick lol\n",
      "good lore good story gameplay is challenging. i really wish we were able to personally choose a 5 star and 4 stars side banner that we wanted as a permanent thing its extremely hard waiting for specific 5 star banner characters every other few weeks to even months its ridiculous and time consuming. btw a few of the skills on lower 3 tier weapons should be changed as well might be cus im still kinda new but i find some really useless for almost all of my characters.\n",
      "its a good game but crazy expensive too get characters and level them. biggest gripe is that the camera moves around during battles so that half the time the view is blocked by grass rocks or buildings. i know its to be cinematic and works well on flat ground but incredibly annoying on other terrain and screwed me over a few times on bosses. please give option to turn it off.\n",
      "it is a really fun game just recently i have had some issues. first i do play on chrombeook because finically it is the best i can do but it crashes after preparing to load data. second there isnt any controller support and it is stuck using the mobile layout which is a pain for non touchscreen devices. third and finially there are some asset files that simply dont download for example dvalin is wings crystals and glowing eyes no neck or body. overall i love the game but cant play.\n",
      "amazing music graphics ive been playing off on since the start while i dont have all the characters or their constellations i still have a lot of fun playing. the free events rewards the web daily login rewards are helpful. the map from their tools helps a lot. i love that you can solo it all or you can choose multi. i play this on the pc with a numbered gaming mouse so im glad i can change keybinds. if you can try both mobile pc versions to see which is best for you.\n",
      "amazing i never experience any bugs or glitches and it runs smoothly and i can enjoy the gameplay. the game is super fun and i love the storyline and the events that make the game even better to enjoy. but the wishing system makes it harder for free to play players that dont want to spend any money on primogems. other than that you can still have fun with the characters that you get. i will say that inazuma has really hard puzzles they make me cry. ok im done but yeah get the game \n",
      "amazing map characters banners events bosses and overall deserves 5 stars. i love the graphics story domains. it does take a really long time to load when you first download takes up space but that doesnt matter compared to the story and lore. great game. i love the banners although ive heard the older characters like klee dont get reruns often. i got early pity on both xiao and standard banner. great characters i fell in love on like the first day playing it. thanks hoyolab \n",
      "i love it the characters the scenery the updates ect. its such a fun game and its pretty realistic in certain ways. like the creator of genshin deserves a noble peice price. the only thing is how you have to buy outfits and other stuff but its the best game i have ever played and im looking for more updates and banners.\n",
      "this game is very vast and beautiful. the storyline is engrossing and entertaining. i enjoy every game feature but the advancing through the story while obtaining characters and advancing them is extremely uneven. you are forced to buy characters to be able to defeat difficult bosses because you need drops from those bosses in order to advance certain characters. its very disheartening. and the difficulty is getting harder and harder. its sad because the game is soo beautiful.\n",
      "genshin impact prides itself on story and exploration the only problem i have is the lack of a skip button for story and cutscenes. there were times where a story boss took me a while to beat. in these occasions i had to go through the same unskippable cut scenes dialogue and tedious boss phases just to get another shot at the part i mainly have trouble on. besides that the game is great and is to an extent very f2p freindly. so far at ar 35 it has yet to feel p2w. but is tough at times\n",
      "good game i had a lot of fun playing this but after finishing the main storyline the game gets quite boring unfortunately and while they do update the main quest after a while it takes a lot of space on my phone for me to almost never play it. however the character variety is great the weapons are great and can be quite a challenge. really open world which is awesome and the experiences i had were great but after a little bit its gets boring. over all good game though\n",
      "my internet works fine i put my data on when i play and i can not log in. i could play fine before 2.7 but not anymore. sure i lagged sometimes but not like this. when i get to the door on the loading screen it just kicks me out. i dont know what to do. i decided to delete it. alr so i deleted it and redownloaded and its all good now so yay \n",
      "game is pretty fun and has a good base but the lack of endgame content outside of artifact farming gear equipment and spiral abyss makes this game feel empty once you complete the daily commissions use up resin and have already challenged the abyss for the current rotation. i dont expect anything related to endgame be implemented in the near future. but with how the games story is slowly inching towards the end something new and permanent would be nice.\n",
      "this game is overall good although at some points in life the game would stop working. after updates it would just shut down or you would not be able to enter the game. it would make you download it again and take up massive amounts of space when you already had it downloaded and an account. for me this is a big problem that i feel like can be fixed i think this game is perfect otherwise. 33\n",
      "so i really like the game for the most part. however during the battle with the electro cube thing it would just reset and i could not beat it. my friends have also had this trouble. the rest of the game is just fine. that bug just really upset me since i need the drops from it to upgrade my characters. i understand that this is a really big game so i have no trouble waiting for fixes.\n",
      "simply put i love the game. the world characters artstyle combat and music will suck you in. you dont need to spend any money to get cool characters feel powerful and clear all the content. and there are a couple great options for light spenders so no need to whale. my only wish is for more permanent combat focused endgame. but try it out i promise youll have fun.\n",
      "the game has a great lore and plot but idk if its just my phone or if its the game. so everytime i play its kinda slow but im somewhat fine with it. but then a few mins later when im trying to switch characters it either wont change or a few seconds later it does but then reconnects the server same with fighting healing and all that and its getting rlly annoying otherwise its beautiful and has a good story to it\n",
      "ive been playing this game s lot and i really like it. the graphics are amazing it keeps my mind engaged with all the lore and missions. its a game that takes a little bit of strategy to play so you wont just be aimlessly running g around in it. only thing bad i really have to say is that it doesnt have a pause button in co op mode that is \n",
      "good gameplay and really impressive world scale. incredible that its f2p. i dont mind the grind sometimes and when i find i get bored or am stuck i just put it down and come back after a few weeks or more. the main problem i have is the lack of diversity in characters physically regarding skin tones body shapes hair types etc and diversity in game items like weapon types combat styles across characters. for a fantasy game there is very little fantasy in the design of these things.\n",
      "let me first start off by saying that this game is incredible this game is not p2w pay to win its f2p free to play 100 the graphics incredible the music incredible the stories incredible the cutscenes incredible if you ever played chrono cross or final fantasy for the consoles then this is the game for you the file is big 20gb but its worth it imo youll need a powerful phone to play this although you can change graphics to low that takes away the exp. have fun \n",
      "i loved the game but sometimes it gets boring. just doing quest and farming domains. it keeps crashing. every 5 minutes or so please stop the crashing in the mobile add something fun and then the game is good please stop the crashing its annoying me so much. but without the crashing its a pretty good game\n",
      "this game is very amazing and entertaining the graphics are perfect and i would give it a five star but i have one problem when i play for some reason the game freezes and kicks me out randomly and it make the game really slow but i still think it is amazing for ipad or pc. it also take up too much data i had to get a second memory chip so i could download this and keep my other apps besides all of that this game is perfect.\n",
      "played since launch max adventure rank. this is one of the greatest multi platform game one can ask for. it may be a gacha game but it certainly doesnt feel like one. the combat playstyle story music and visuals are absolutely top tier youd be missing out by not trying it and enjoying what a masterpiece of a game this is. whats even better you can play on any platform with cross saves across all to play wherever and on whatever with same account as you wish. 10 10\n",
      "the difficulty ratio when leveling up to a new world level seems heavily unbalanced. ive been playing this game since it debuted but it keeps getting harder and i have been stuck for months. its frustrating when this game has beautiful graphics and a wonderful storyline. hard to keep pressing on when my player level is so low and it takes forever to grind away leveling up and not seeing much of a return.\n",
      "there is a lot i love about it great characters beautiful setting interesting story. but it has some drawbacks mainly the repetitive nature of a lot of the smaller quests especially the daily ones go do this small thing that is exactly the same as the last time which very well might have been yesterday. but the biggest change id like to see is making the 10 pull more meaningful tons of gacha gamrs like this make it a 10 1 pull just doesnt feel worthwhile to save for the big one.\n",
      "probably the best free gaming experience ive ever played at least on android and the ability to play across other platforms is great too but honestly i have had the easiest time pulling for good characters and equipment in this game than any other game and i actually like the characters fully voiced and with their own unique abilities \n",
      "good game. the early game is really immersive and the story hooked me. the open world is beautiful and great to explore. however as you venture more into the game and level up playing becomes more of a chore than an enjoyable experience. this is due to the lack of content that players will experience when they hit higher levels ar 50 . adding more end game content and implementing relevant player feedback would improve this game immensely. hopefully this will be done in the near future.\n",
      "updated 8 24 22 i absolutely adore this game ive been playing for almost 2 years now very consistently. there was only one occasion where i got busy and took a longer break from the game. i like the combat system characters and lore especially but for a long while and especially as of recently theres been an extreme lack of diversity. hoyoverse is making their regions based off real places with real people who do not look like how the game has chosen to represent them.\n",
      "seriously the most addicting game out there theres a reason that so many people play this game. its cool because you can either play on your own exploring the entire massive world doing quests while collecting and upgrading on your own. or you can invite up to 4 other people from around the world to play with you. so much stuff to do and its all 100 totally f2p ive been playing for over a year and ive never needed to pay a single dollar. try it for yourself and youll be thanking me later \n",
      "been playing since launch on both pc and mobile but mobile seems to be an awful experience 80 percent of the time. this game really needs a toggle for single player so it plays better. recently been playing tower of fantasy on mobile and it runs better with multi player real time users compared to genshins domains stuck at constant 999ms which dont require multi player. please consider a single player mode or an option to opt out of multi player for mobile users thanks \n",
      "one of the best free to play games period. its not play to win. but if you want to get some of the really cool characters you might need to spend a bit of money. you can still get a chance to get the 5 star characters without it just takes a great deal of time and grinding and even then its not always guaranteed. but overall absolutely amazing. they are always updating with new materials. quests lines and boss battles. epic is an understatement \n",
      "it is a really good game. the graphics and the music are just beautiful. i do think it takes up quite a bit of space but it is worth it. i think this game really makes an impact hehe get what i did there on myself. most of the time when im not fighting monsters its very calming and fun. i definitely would recommend 3\n",
      "literally just. brainrotting over this game so much lore characters yessss. fair warning for beginners though the game takes a while to download and the controls are a bit odd at first but just fiddle around in the beginning and youll figure it out. its worth it in the end \n",
      "i adore the game i love the graphics and the characters. the only problem i ever run into is that my game crashes consistently and the only way to fix it is by restarting my phone. i dont really complain as i figured it was just a problem with my phone as it has not happened to the other mobile players ive known.\n",
      "this game is absolutely amazing you should totally get it. the only problem for me is that i cant get the quest undetected infiltration. ive done everything. ive logged out i even uninstalled the app and installed it again and that still didnt work. i had someone else do it for me which that didnt work either. another thing is i cant see the health on hillichurls and stuff. another than that this game is rlly fun i would rlly love to get this problem fixed tho ty \n",
      "i could say its a fun game to play but i can never really get the whole experience of playing the game anytime i open the game and it fully loads in like 5 seconds later it freeze and i dont know how to stop it from doing that people on google say lower the some the graphics settings but i can never do that because it always freezes before i get the chance too. but overall a pretty good game.\n",
      "im going to be 100 honest. genshin impact is the most addicting game ever better than minecraft actually. i love the game design and i think the idea kf u locking new regions with different elements in them is truly fascinating. the graphic designs are beautiful and i love how every dcharacter has a unique design that originates from their homeland. the plot of the entire game is also amazing and has a great lead on the stories. overall best game ever \n",
      "sure the game has amazing graphics and is easily the best free game though i do not like how i have to delete all my apps just to play and for it not to load me in. the amount of storage it takes up is unbelievable and unnecessary. i would play if it would allow me to its been sitting in my apps for around an hour while i try to see if you guys have a discord sever. please fix this problem.\n",
      "i play on ps4 and mobile and its great. all of it is perfect except the fact that it randomly kicks me out while playing. i have absolutely no problems on my ps4 but it normally takes about 5 minutes after i enter the game for it to kick me out. this has happened for a very long time and honestly im surprised you havent fixed this yet. im not sure if its my phone that is not working well with the app or what but i have a galaxy s20 fe 5g. please fix this thanks \n",
      "its definitely a cute and fun game definitely worth a try if one is bored. my only real grievance with it is that its hard to get any characters. primocrystals take forever to accumulate it be much better that if you get 15 or 20 as rewards instead of 5. i quit once before because i could never get any decent characters or i got more weapons then i ever needed. other then that pretty fun.\n",
      "the first couple weeks playing the game feel phenomenal since the story is amazing and the progression is great. after a while though it gets repetitive and content appears once in a while. players have been having problems with lack of 2fa and lack of action against hacks. feedback allows you to state concerns but players tend to get back automated messages and nothing official. changes may occur randomly and the f2p friendlyness is okay i guess.\n",
      "its a fun game. ive played it on ipad pc and android. im giving 3 stars because out of all the platforms ive played this on android probably the least fun. the no controller support is a deal breaker. using a controller is the main way i enjoy playing this. i really like genshin impact. it just frustrating theres no controller support on android.\n",
      "loads of gameplay and no paywall holding you back like many games. my only complaint is that for as long as this game has existed and as long as ive been asking there is still no inverted y axis controls for pc and mobile. it exists for anything with a controller but nothing else.\n",
      "this game is absolutely amazing incredible graphics an amazing storyline and interesting characters. however my phone can no longer hold the game. the amount of storage this takes is ridiculous and im going to have to uninstall because id like to have other apps on my phone. if you really enjoy genshin impact its ultimately better to play on a different device. it runs very smoothly and storage is not a problem when i play on pc \n",
      "the game is really fun. very entertaining. but i have some concerns i dont know if its just me but when i first downloaded the game. the quality was perfection. but now its very blurry and blunt and the sound crashes a lot which makes me suddenly get out of the game. and the storage is a huge problem. after the 2.7 update my phone just couldnt take it so i had to uninstall. but it does run very nicely on my pc or ipad without any problems.\n",
      "this game is gorgeous and fun and so easy to lose track of time playing. i get really sucked into the world. it does take up a lot of space but i feel it is absolutely worth it. i have it in my phone and on my ps4. though playing on mobile can be really tricky at times. i recently learned i can connect a bluetooth controller to my phone but there is no setting on mobile for a controller option. \n",
      "really awesome game i play it almost everyday. the graphics story character designs mechanics the overall contents of the game are impeccable. the only problem is it tends to crash on my device whenever i enter multiplayer especially during domains. other than that this is one of the best games i have ever played and youll get addicted faster than james charless career flopped.\n",
      "great game i wish it were easier to get primogems so players wouldnt have to decide between skipping three banners and paying high amounts of money for the characters they want but that probably wont be changing. also the resin cap both condensed and regular are painful. resin recovers excruciatingly slowly and then the condensed cap makes it difficult to do much without stopping all the time to make more. excited for the future though i guess. the music and landscapes are beautiful.\n",
      "the game is good has a story world and characters that keep me coming back and i play regularly on pc. but it turns out you kind of need a relatively newish phone to play the mobile version. granted my phone isnt super old but the mobile version shouldnt be so unstable that its a gamble if i can even get past the title screen. it feels like while this is a good looking game for mobile its the fact that its so graphically intensive that keeps it from being playable on mobile.\n",
      "i never liked to play mobile games and cross platform didnt seem viable to me. but this game made me change my mind it plays well on mobile and pc and has a really good gradual introduction of gameplay features. maybe even a bit to gradual slow but maybe thats trying to enjoy it to the max and trying to every sidequest before moving on. its just great and really well made. addictive as well but thats what a good game should be and its hard to not be tempted to play when i should work...\n",
      "the visuals music and characters designs are amazing and blends so well together that playing the game and exploring new places just makes me feel entranced everytime. i would have given it a 5 review if not for the fact that farming for primogems to wish is a tiring process. other than that i love the game and i dont think i plan on deleting it anytime soon.\n",
      "im in love with this game nice graphics and super aesthetic sceneries. frequent updates with new characters events quests and areas to explore. the music is also super nice and always fits sometimes i even listen to it on spotify when im studying . like all of this is really stunning for an free app without any ads. only pity some important story quests are time limited events so if you miss out on them some things might be a bit confusing but ill strongly recommend anyway \n",
      "the game is amazing and super underrated. would give this a 5 5 on pc but on mobile its rlly laggy and the controls are clunky. if you have a pc i would rlly recommend as its free and the combat is rlly fun. however with the new updates i feel the world map is becoming much too big and the new areas feel very repetitive and as if ill only visit them once and then move onto the next area. it doesnt help that each new city has much harder puzzles and now each takes at least 10 mins\n",
      "top of the line graphics and gameplay and if you study east asian languages this game is perfect for you because its fully translated and voiced in chinese japanese and korean. my main complaints are its high battery use device temperature and battery drain. also its an always online game even when youre on single player so you cant play it without a connection. its incredibly addictive but not very time consuming unless you want to do more.\n",
      "im in love with this game ive been playing for year or two and its really addicting because of the gameplay quests graphics music and etc. but so many updates and the game storage growing is a problem for me. i had to delete genshin on my pc because i was out of storage and had to download it on phone. i just wish it didnt take that much of storage.\n",
      "im loving the game very much. tho there are a few visual glitches like the enemys health bar disappearing after certain events occur like using fischls burst getting hit by a gravediggers projectile and riding the waverider. it doesnt really affect me that much but it really gets annoying sometimes. hopefully you may be able to fix this once the 3.0 update come. cheers \n",
      "ive been playing genshin impact for almost a year or maybe more lol. the game has awesome graphics and storyline the characters have a great designs and backstories. i dont really have any issues or bugs to report just wanted to say that the game is amazing. im very excited for the new version 3.0 to come out and for the new characters. thank you for letting us experience such a great game and to think its free makes it even better \n",
      "it was fun when youre starting playing it but as you progress it will get hard at a certain point. if you have a lot of patience in building upgrading a certain character you want this game is good for you. edit due to the new update the game became laggy keep crashing and its been hard to control the keys to mobile users . im not satisfied in terms of the new setting update.\n",
      "have been enjoying playing the game on ps4 and was looking to play more on my phone while away only to discover that the android version doesnt have controller support but the ios version does. been having alot of fun with the game but as it stands i cant get the full experience from the mobile version at the moment due to something i assume would be very easy to add to the game as they have already done it fot ios.\n",
      "beautiful game beautiful music. i wouldnt recommend if you arent prepared to grind. dont expect to get characters unless you grind and save for at least 2 full updates or spend money. artifact system desperately needs to change. many characters are in need of reworks and or buffs im hoping theyll eventually do something about this but i doubt it will change. after a certain level playing often feels like a chore and can lose almost all enjoyability.\n",
      "love it the melodies and scenes are all very calming the characters are unique and this game has a bunch of secrets and mysteries that make you wanna play it longer. the problems are that it takes up a lot of space my mobile phone may not be able to take up the space so im deciding if i should keep it or not. it is hard to grind artifacts in my opinion and its very likely to lose 50 50. all downsides aside this game has a lot of attractive characters. one of the reasons i love it. a bi\n",
      "ive been playing this game since 1.6 and the gameplay graphics world building and the characters are all great. however this recent update has been less pleasant since the game would often crash. at first i thought the problem is my device but after hearing from my friends that they also experienced the same thing i hope the devs would fix this soon. it really discouraged me to go back at the loading screen again.\n",
      "keeps you playing for hours and the events are versatile and fun. you can see that the developers put their everything into it from music to characters to the design of the areas. although the story pace is a bit lacking but to each their own. edit the sumeru update is a huuuge step up from previous patches. the area is amazing and i dont even feel like sprinting but just walking around looking at the scenery. the archon story is perfect. havent felt so immersed in a while.\n",
      "no words can explain how amazing the game is the graphics the characters the story but there is a problem collecting primogems is a bit hard. there is a quest called in the mountains its too hard and it takes a lot of effort stay close to the fire and fight 3 robots in the end i get 40 primogems. please can you make collecting it a bit easier thank you so much for your hard work \n",
      "this game is absolutely incredible the only issue i have isnt really the games fault. since my phone is god awful every time im doing a serious challenge like an ascension challenge it always crashes just when im about to finish it. id love it if you were able to spawn back into the domain or elemental trial to pick up where you left off.\n",
      "it is nice and beautiful game and through the years of developing it i can say that it improved a lot. though there are some bugs and issues that is needed to be fixed as soon as possible especially the issue in downloading and updating. a lot of users experiencing it especially in pc when downloading or updating the game there are a lot of error before you can even downloaded it 100 . i hope these issues will be fixed soon. anyway it is a definitely a successful game after all.\n",
      "i dont think i have to explain why this game is so incredibly beautiful. the graphics the storyline the characters are all very unique and wonderful although im encountering a problem the quest chasm spelunkers seems to have disappeared from the menu even though i remember doing the first half of it but suddenly it made me go to the designated location to investigate and i cant do it i have to complete the chasm spelunkers but again as i said it disappeared please help\n",
      "one of my favourite games. i can easily say that ill be sticking with it till the last update and beyond. the controls and features are quick to learn making this a great game for new players. the character design and open world are some of my favourite things its difficult to run out of things to do in genshin. one thing id like to see more of in the future is characters with diverse body types and skin tones it would be nice to see a diverse range of characters.\n",
      "well... it is by far one of the biggest open world mobile games ive ever played. endless combinations of fighting styles play styles and very easy to jump in and jump back out. numerous events user friendly and f2p at that. you can also join other players or have them join your world. its never ending and so much lore underneath a beautiful enduring landscape. theres cooking and reading and looting. controls can be a little wonky sometimes. and be prepared to use a phone charger. enjoy \n",
      "its very relaxing despite my graphics being on the lowest. the music is incredible. the gameplay is very casual and easy. if you focus on the gacha system and focusing so much with your characters damage you totally missing out the fun. be grateful with what you get twt . but even so being on high ar with no more events its quite hard for us to have something to do in the game. and please reduce the size of the game in mobile not all of us can afford a new one. looking forward to it \n",
      "the game itself is absolutely amazing the lore music character designs weapon designs i just love them all. although i do have a problem with one thing and thats the gameplay i just wished you can modify the controls to your liking another one is that the graphics are just...too much every time i try to move my character i experience some serious fps drops there is also alot of lag when picking up loot drops. so maybe you can improve on that \n",
      "its very fun to play. the storyline is very captivating and the character designs are very beautiful. the open world concept is the best in mobile gaming theres so many areas to explore and the scenery fit the lore of the region. the game music is very addictive especially during certain quests. pretty f2p friendly as well. but as you got to higher level theres not much to do when waiting for a new patch so it get pretty boring for awhile.\n",
      "thanks for your great game. its really enjoyable and fun to play. just ive got a small problem and it looks like a bug actually . in through the mist quest theres a problem with relay stones that doesnt connect yo the right one and ive checked everything and im sure about the others. i dont know if its just my issue or other players have faced it or not. thanks and i hope youll fix it.\n",
      "the game is great the character design the voice acting the environment the storyline and most importantly the music. i love playing the game on my phone even though its not the best experience i could get from the game. lately i got a macbook and found out i cant download it in it. since it does work on pc i couldnt find a reason for it to not work on macbook. please add the option.\n",
      "this game is really good its fun due to its graphics characters designs puzzles and more its fun doing the archon quests and exploring new things getting characters and more but i do wish that in 3.1 that they will add a button in the settings to make paimon follow you sorry if its too much to ask i just love this idea \n",
      "definitely the best game ive ever played before but i think i made a mistake of killing the bandits before getting the the millennial mountains quest and now even after the bandits respawn i killed them again but no dialogues pop up and even when i go to the valley where the cup of commons is kept there were none. im thinking of restarting my whole adventure from square one it would be fun though maybe ill do that. but overall this is hands down the best game i have ever played\n",
      "overall its an addictive game from gacha to puzzles and many more. the thing mihoyo should also add up to genshin for a better experience and gameplay is configuration of controls. yes it is already present on pc but not on mobile. it will really help all the player if they are able to configure the buttons especially if they are the type of person that keeps their things organized and are convenient for them.\n",
      "the game is very fun to play although im always skipping the dialogue a lot cuz the fighting style is more interesting. the puzzles are great. its a great game but no end game. just one suggestion can we just have a choice. where you can choose what you prefer black screen or white screen in the main screen after you opened game it hurts your eyes a lot. and thank you if you reading this.\n",
      "the world is absolutely beautiful and have a fantastic and rich lore. all the arcon quests and step quests thats out are absolutely amazing and i love them all. you can see a great improvement from the launch. and i do hope to see more of it. the playable characters are well design and have all their own charm also begin well beloved by someone like me. there are always the downsides in a game like this. but i hope to see it evolve and grow with time. ive enjoyed my time a lot. thank you.\n",
      "the sceneries characters design and storyline are super amazing ive been playing this game a few weeks before launch. this is the best rpg game ive played so far and its very good but it lags too much for me i havent been playing for a long time because it was too laggy so i had to delete it. i just reinstall the game a few weeks ago and as i continue to play it got more laggy. ive tried reinstalling it again but after that it still kept crashing.\n",
      " a console pc game thats able to run on phone. probably the best description i could think of. its got the open world correct deym the map is huge .the combat is also pretty good as its not ur typical hack and slash type rather a create elemental reaction for huge damage combat. dailys can be a bit annoying but the rewards make up for it. really dont need any banner units to enjoy the game and if u want to just save for the pity. all in all is a pretty good game.\n",
      "the game experience is amazing and even getting better with every update. but... something is bothering me... story quests and archon quests must be replayable after completing and claiming the rewards. that whould be a great ability while you have a chance to play and enjoy the stories again. plz add this feature to the game while thats not really a complicated thing. all of the sources are exist in the game data and youve just need add a list of completed stories with a replay option.\n",
      "this game is really fun but the problem is...when i started replaying the game to experience the cutscenes and excitement again there was a bug or glitch that just made me stuck at that archon quest. i want to do a domain so i can progress further but the screen just freeze so i waited for atleast 3p minutes and it just freezed. i logged out and did the domain again but it was useless. tried this for more than 5 times and im sick of it. please fix it hoyoverse \n",
      "ive only started playing on late 2.5 update bcos i didnt have anybcompatible device with this game but ive seen my friends and streamers play this. in march this year i finally had the chance to play it myself. i might be exaggerating for some but in this generation of open world games this is one of the best and the best. the mechanics the combat the puzzles the graphics character designs and especially the story are just top notch. cant wait to see more \n",
      "i love genhsin impact its an awesome game only problem is that it continuously glitches and way too much. like for examamples i could be fighting a boss and itll glitch mid fight and id loose health. or i could be watching one of the uninteractive scenes and i wouldnt be able to see it and the voices would also glitch. but overrall i absolutely love this game. its probably the best vidiogame ive played in awhile.\n",
      "after entering sumeru version 3.0 update it feels like the game is more amazing. so many new contents archon quests chain of many world quests new events new area to explore sumeru . i think it will take a lot of my time to clear all of those. the new map sumeru area is so complex. not to mention the new dendro element. new characters to develop too.\n",
      "genshin is a beautiful game with one of the best quality graphics music and story line. however the game may be difficult for new players since its always updating and takes up lots of space on your device. if new players arent willing to spend much time on getting artifacts and building characters then they may not play. and talking in chat may be a problem as it is limited to short paragraphs.other than that genshin is one of the best games ive played and it will continue to be that way.\n",
      "one of the best games with amazing graphics and one that the advertisement and promotional videos are actually how it looks like in the game. the laggyness some players experience is due to either their own phone or wifi. i had the same problem with disconnecting with my old phone but got a new one and the graphics are absolutely amazing.\n",
      "this is a very nice game with beautiful scenery and fights. the only problem is with the size of the game. now it is taking 20 gb of my phone space. well for that level of graphics it may need that much space but i would be happy if i can delete unwanted things like voice lines and other things from my space to reduce the burden on my phone. otherwise my phone may die by next year.\n",
      "this is a solid rpg game with amazing story lore and characters. the world is pretty and detailed many times i forgot all about my quest and side tracked into exploring it. there were many moments when i just stopped to enjoy the view. talking about the gacha part its not too bad to be honest you can get through the story and clear most content with free characters. if you save enough you can easily get a couple of 5 stars by ar45. it may be a bit spec heavy on phone i mostly play on pc.\n",
      "seen i started playing ive experienced new things and learned a lot by the stories. playing with friends also feels good. ive been attached to this game . graphics are good and i can run it smoothly in medium. but only one problem. please make more source of primogems. getting a new character is really hard .\n",
      "haha. this game... blew my mind i was hesitant to play after seeing the size of it but downloaded it anyway. mind blowing literally the best game in adventure genre. im able to run it on max settings and its been almost 2 days playing it. found it hard to get whats going in game like quests but after sometime got used to it. i havent experienced any bugs or glitches or lags till now. will update my comment if i found one. ive recommended one of my friends also. im sure hell love it.\n",
      "this is undoubtedly my favorite open world game but i have a few complaints. im really hoping that theyll introduce the use of my chromebooks keyboard since using the mobile layout doesnt always give the best gameplay. i also wish that they could add dmg numbers since it gets annoying when i cant see how much i do when i test my characters. its also a bummer that i cannot see ice when water gets frozen in the game. moreoever the storyline the characters and the events are great \n",
      "this is the only game which has been in my phone for more than 2 years. love the story graphics and character designs they have created. the 45fps option is really good for me since 60fps was draining the battery pretty fast. although the occasional lag is still there. here in india iam getting 300ms ping mobile data and would like it to be atleast below 200ms for smoother switching characters and other experiences. thats all.\n",
      "genshin impact is a really beautiful game and i love it though theres some bugs here and there on potato phones like the old yun jin and stormterror bug they already fixed it theres still some left like you cant see grass you cant see damage they really need to fix those. overall this is a fun game with tons of freedom to explore the land thats available at the moment the character designs are really cool cute and very detailed good luck to the new travelers out there ehe b\n",
      "its great the graphcics are great in pc but not much in phone. the story is continuous and really nice i love coming back home to play genshin. i have been playing it for 3 years now and it has never dissapointed me in any way. even the character designs are great and their movements are fluid in total the game is great and i would recommend anyone to play it.\n",
      "ive never played a mobile game this long and almost everyday on my life that shows how addicting the game is but in a good way. the only frustration i have is that some events requires a lot of your time and attention and as a worker its really a problem sometimes. but not all event are like that so i know mihoyo is considering all players. graphics lore and gameplay are definitely to die for. a game with constant updates and new contents genshin impact has it all for you \n",
      "truly one of the best games ive been fortunate enough to experience. the characters the lore the gameplay the exploring even tho its tedious for me i adore this game and it has helped me meet great people. the only issue for me is the game gets bland when you reach a higher level and theres not much to do towards the end of the update except to wait for the new update. i hope they introduce some permanent things to keep us high ar level entertained.\n",
      "this is such a good game even if it needs a lot of storage to download i still love it and the character designs the battle scenes and the story line everything is amazing and theres so much little details that i love and im not gonna lie but i do want more dark skinned characters or maybe more representation but i do understand that everything is already planned out so im not going to complain but overall its an amazing game \n",
      "the story is exquisite. it is incredible and the action is just right. the music is not only tailored to fit the regions but im amazed by how beautiful they all sound. all details including the finer details when you look closer at them can really be worth exploring. truly an experience worth the storage and worth spending money on despite it being a free game. well done in creating such and excellent story game.\n",
      "this game is amazing this game is so much fun i play it whenever i can edit still love this game but there are a few problems it takes too much storage to be used on most devices. on chomebook the only device i can currently use for this game you cannot use the keyboard only the touch screen. and as of now it crashes every time i attempt to start it. \n",
      "i really love this game it my favourite already but .. there is a little issue that i would like you to fix please recently ive got to inazuma and well.. you can say that things havent been going well honestly . it takes too long to download the area i keep falling every time i try to walk or climb adding that i cant even walk a single step without the game stopping and in the videos in the main quests it always turns into a black screen its really hard to play without being able to move\n",
      "its amazing and all but my phone cant take that much storage and there are already many things that i have a problem with especially visual bugs. like the grass ice on bodies of water and especially the damage taken not being seen. overall its a great game i love it sm but please do fix these visual bugs as it greatly affects the gameplay. much love to hoyoverse 3\n",
      "ive been playing this game for maybe 1y and i enjoy it though its extremely not perfect this is the kind of game where you have to grind it which can get exhausting and the rng of everything can be very unfair but the lore is amazing and the world is big and beautiful to explore yes its not just the anime waifus this game is actually good. i do have some issues with the phone version im playing on pixel 5 and i have a lot of connectivity issues and it constantly reconnects. 7.8 10\n",
      "game is good and i love the stories quests and characters all of them but except for one thing for low end pcs or phones. the long loading just ruins it for me and you might know why. its so triggering right when the wrong moment comes picking up something either they run away or when the loot from the chest rolls down and fall plus when you try to open the map adv book characters etc. it loads soooo long while you watch your character die from the monsters or fatui.\n",
      "an amazing app good graphics a bit laggy but that is kinda my devices fault and no major problems so far. well there was two problems that made me not play genshin for a solid 4 months but both were my stupidity. not turning around and looking at a fricking wall thinking the 2nd floor is broken ect. . no ads i think and a good storyline.\n",
      "great game great graphics fun reacton system cool character design bad resin timer greedy company zero communication zero transparency. if you want a game to play for 5 years this is it just make sure you dont do all the story in one go because youll get burned out. let yourself be lost while traveling the world. as for me as a player since release story and events eventually end and i only log in to do commission and use up all resin and im out. which is just sad...\n",
      "very nice set up the characters and the scenery are awesome... if the device have much space and a good network.. the game is super fun to play with no lags and glitch what so ever... it really fun to play. just the issue is the storage. when inazuma map came it took half of the total storage and now with sumeru coming along i think i might have to drop this game since my phone cant handle this much space. pls give the users the right to delete some old files to reduce storage consumption.\n",
      "i had installed genshin on my phone it was fine. now ive been trying for last 3 days to install it on my samsung tablet but no matter how much space it has it does not work. stop giving us that pop up screen that says hint not enough storage. just tell us how many gb we need instead of that quirky pop up screen that annoys the hell out of everybody i dont know what the bug is that makes it so it doesnt like samsung but you need to fix it cuz i like gension but its frustrating\n",
      "its been a while of playing and i only hope the artifact system gets better anyhow. the story and everything else related to characters are always of great quality the things behind that though need a lot of polishing like the abyss to make it easier for newer and less punishing to new players.\n",
      "i want to say that i started to play this game around 9 months ago and on my old phone xiaomi mi 8 it worked without problems except the overheating one that i think most phones suffer of . but now on the samsung s22 exynos it has some really annoying crashes while in certain boss domains example signora . the boss would spawn only half like only the head and the legs and after getting to the 2nd phase it completely freezes the game and the phone. so just 2 for the mobile vers. sadly.\n",
      "really fun game to distract you from stress entertain you and help you interact with more people gain new friends. very interesting stories that make you want to watch it all as ive never skipped a single story. its a very cool game and would certainly recommend to anyone into adventurous interactive and entertaining games. my only small complaint is that it can be laggy sometimes but it might be cause of my device or my lack of storage. overall its a great game solid 100 100.\n",
      "great characters amazing music. there is one thing. for example it is very hard to get primogems but project sekai its very easy and fun to get the get gems i would like thag fixed because most of my friends including me uninstalled this app becauss we couldnt get the characters. now i downloaded it again and lets hole it will be better. i want to see your opinion on this please.\n",
      "its really good but whenever dvalin appears the screen becomes glitchy so i cant see or aim im up to the part where you have to get rid of the blood clots on dvalin but i cant see so it makes it impossible could you please fix it i cant see so i cant defeat the boss. if i cant defeat the boss i cant advance in the story. theres also another weird glitch where when a water surface is frozen i cant see the ice but others can. edit thanks so much the glitches have been fixed d\n",
      "perfect game for me. i love the characters graphics lore music strategy etc. it has tons of content but most of the content only needs to be done once instead of over and over again so not grindy at all which fits perfectly in my busy schedule. the game just keeps getting better and never fails to keep surprising me.\n",
      "absolutely love this game the garphics the fights the story the characters i love it all. i definitely recommend this game to people who what an open world to explore characters to upgrade an amazing story as well as side quest to complete puzzles to solve daily content etc. but good things come at a cost and for this its storage . as well as a good phone and good wifi. but overall its a nice game highly recommended. resin system is trash . \n",
      "graphic music ost gameplay map character design and especially the lore is excellent. its a good game to relieve stress unless youre a meta player . but the game is not optimized yet for most device especially android . after each update its lagging. i hope theyll fix that in the future.\n",
      "amazing video game super addictive. the visuals are amazing you get to explore a whole world play as different characters learn more about the character s stories and do so many things i especially love the storyline and visuals even though im kinda behind on the archon quests.. i love rpgs and i like the unique battle styles. i wish there were ways to get primogems easier though..\n",
      "i love the game. its really fun to play theres so much story a lot of things to explore and find but it gets a bit boring later. the gacha system takes ages you barely get enough primogems from activities. saving primos takes ages. and theres the lack of diversity while the character designs are enjoyable and unique theres no diversity in body types and skin color. please do improve that that the slow paced farming for materials are points of critique for an otherwise enjoyable game.\n",
      "as someone who has played since launch it can start to get tedious the longer you play it as dailies become a repeat of doing coms spending resin and logging out. what really gets me staying is the story lore and worldbuilding which is absolutely amazing. the open world is stunning too. i think the wishing system overall is fine. the artifact system however definitely needs more work. the resin also should have a shorter regeneration rate and a way to store excess resin like in honkai.\n",
      "been playing since the first version still my favourite game. open world without everyone else running around in one server like hell i like it with a vast map to explore myself and co op is optional. i can just immerse myself in the graphics well structured storyline and lores. i love the music and voices esp. in korean. despite very low probability of getting your favourite character..but a long run f2p like me patient enough to save some primos can get a decent one time to time.\n",
      "its actually a beautiful game the graphics and quality is perfect and the story line is also enjoyful and i love how everyone is making theories about the game i really love the wishing animation too this is a good work and also i love the character designs voice lines . but i really hate this thing because the new version out is not available for my phone and it is not allowed in my phone so i cant really update it but now i cant play because of that please fix it i worked hard \n",
      "cool very fun cant stop playing edit 50 adventure levels later and the game glitches for me to the point i cant play it glitch makes it impossible to enjoy playing archon quests because those big fights should be most fun right well because of the glitch that happens every time i do multiple attacks at once the game glitches to the point my phone overheats and im not able to play anywhere other than a phone and up until now i enjoyed this game too much .. disappointed ... very.. fix\n",
      "this game is honestly addicting but i quite enjoy it thought there are a few problems i experience when using an samsung phone who i wish they could change. for example at times it gets a little laggy i cant do weekly bosses because of how bad it lags i cant see my damage my yunjin lags whenever i click on her on the character menu or in coop. id really appreciate if that could be changed.\n",
      "i love the game the storyline the art the environment the character designs i just love everything abt this game. edit is it just me or is the police detention center domain in inazuma bugged cuz whenever i tried to enter it itd just turn into a black screen and i even waited for it to load but it never loaded ive tried to enter it again a few times but it still wont work \n",
      "this game is a big leap for mobile gaming. the other games were as i would call them a work in progress . but this this game is advanced in controls. this was meant for ps4 xbox and pc but the developers worked hard to bring this game to mobile players and they did not sacrifice a feature the game is almost as same as the one on consoles and pc. best graphics gameplay and storyline. must download \n",
      "lacks endgame content however the storyline and lore are good. i really like the concept of the promindial one and i really like the sumeru archon quests so far. i would like this game if they gave npcs some regonization too like rana yinger or dunyarzard. its exploration graphics and world bosses are great too. i hate the concept of resin though just a waste of time in my opinion. the game would be better if they removed the concept of resin and it being all luck based.\n",
      "no game is perfect but genshin impact does set a high bar for future gacha games to compete with. it has tons of detail the world is fun to explore and the story and characterwork is great stuff. the only thing i take issue with in the game is the gacha system but i can forgive it somewhat. characters are much more developed in the game. theyre not just pngs or stats. and i think it sort of justifies it compared to other friendlier gachas where what you pull for isnt exciting at all.\n",
      "the game has a lot of bugs that hasnt been fixed yet. most importantly the bug where the auto target messes up everytime when i use my burst targeting measly slimes instead of other bigger enemies on the opposite side. please fix hoyoverse. but aside from these dumb issues the story and the art are just amazing and the music is mesmerizing\n",
      "this game is unparalleled atm and has riveting gameplay. the story and world building blew my mind they definitely invested into the lore of the game. furthermore the music is insanely good they have a whole orchestra the art scenery puzzles some and land architecture are all exquisite. my only critique is that there needs to be repeatable endgame content preferably multiplayer abyss doesnt count more beginner friendly fairer weapon banners and the skip feature \n",
      "the game is beautiful but it would be great if you add the italian language and make it easier to get primogems i will give 5 stars just in case aside from that the gameplay is well done and the characters with an interesting story too the music is just as good so it deserves to be played. i write it to you in english maybe so listen to the problems of the users...\n",
      "hi i love the game the melodies the sceneries the cut scenes the action the characters everything i dont have any problems but today. our wifi network was suddenly not working while im playing so ive decided to stop for a bit but then when the wifi came back and i opened my account all my progress are gone. like i need to play it all in the very beginning. pls fix this edit omg. i got my account back within a day good job. keep it up. you deserve 5 stars \n",
      "i love this the graphics are incredible each character has its own tailored writing and the gameplay is extraordinary especially for a mobile game keep in mind it does take up quite a lot of space so if you wish to have this game you should clear up some things beforehand. overall its really fun but i have to take off a star because of how it can feel pay to win at times. keep it up devs \n",
      "i love genshin its really cool and all. biggest problem is the space it takes and the lags on mobile but overall the graphics are gorgeous the characters are nice and the story is really interesting theres a lack of content for end game players but the new nations that will come will surely make up for it i hope also scaramouche banner when \n",
      "the game is overall amazing. the storyline the plot and so on. my only problem is that its unfair to people with a slow phone since sometimes you cant see numbers or when there is a cutscene it stops and its just annoying. please fix these so we can have better experience\n",
      "its a great game and all tons of quest to make yourself busy with and great landscape and characters but my problem is how i cant see the damage texts. though im quite grateful for fixing the character and boss texture bug because it was quite a hassle playing the game. can you also make damage texts possible for low end devices too thank you and have a nice day\n",
      "overall the games good and the characters are pretty fun to play too there are also events that keep you busy even though only for a few days. though... i would like to say that maybe its me thats too fast but everytime after i finish an event it feels like theres nothing left to do except doing commissions and domains everyday. it gets pretty boring as it repetitively is like that.. but since it feels like it is my own fault this game is still a recommend edit heizou lesgoooooooooo\n",
      "i really love playing genshin impact. graphics storyline charachters and awarding system are well made. 3rd perspective needs some improvement i think sometimes while fighting after getting a hit i cant see my character or my enemies anymore. 2nd problem im facing is aiming with gyroscope while playing in amber character. its rate of functionality is 12 . rest is good for me im getting to like the game more and more. good job and keep it up.\n",
      "the game is 10 10 really well designed with a lot of events and well writen quests the songs are true masterpieces. the voice actors did a great job aswell.. on the other side the community is pretty bad and i mean it they are one of the most toxic playerbase. ofcourse there are some good people too but they are kind of rare. as a conclusion yes it is worth your time the game is new player friendly and youtube is full of tutorials to help you when you are stuck somewhere\n",
      "this game is awesome you can explore the map and make friends too. sure its a bit laggy on mobile but overall a good game. but theres this one thing when i see some bodys of water it keeps glowing to the point that it became too bright so i would have to look away. please fix this.\n",
      "i love this game very much but there are a few issues that affect the gameplay of mobile users.firstly we cant see the ice in the game whenever we freeze water. secondly the damage numbers. the number of damage done cannot be seen on a lot of mobile players phone and without seeing the damage players will not be able to improve their characters builds. lastly the grass effect in the game which is just a flat piece of land.i hope these problems are resolved soon to allow a better experience\n",
      "edit i have found the way to turn off speech in this game and it becomes immensely better. i am docking a star due to the option to turn off speech being locked behind completing a certain amount of the game dont know why sound settings arent edit able from the beginning... so for that reason alone the game will lose a star. it runs fairly smoothly has interesting mechanics will add more when i eventually play more of this game. definately worth playing for at least a day.\n",
      "the game is good. it has alot of content in it the story line is awesome also characters changing mechanism is very fun. i also love the fact i could join other peoples world and play with them or help them. farming artifacts bosses domains and etc is overwhelming experience. the downsides are the gacha system if i really wanted a specific character im required to pull which means it cost currency so theres a small chance of me getting a 5 star. i highly recommend it tho. its free and fun.\n",
      "i really love the game. they have this characters that looked awesome with their elemental skills especially when you get to try the other characters when you dont have them it feels like you really have the character. and the quests is also mind blowing because its connected to the story and new bosses to fight. my favorite quest in the game is the archon quest because it is the main quest of the story and you get to know everything that had happened in their past life.\n",
      "ever since the 2.8 update i can no longer see the enemies health. at first i thought i could just deal with it until it gets fixed by itself but its getting really really annoying. i also cant see my damage numbers. its a really fun game overall but these few things make the gameplay experience... not so nice.\n",
      "give it 3 stars because when combat gets hectic the touch screen controls fail me all the time. the camera also always moves its way closest to the ground so i constantly have to keep fixing it while fighting. please bring mobile controller support to this game its a must for these types of games which have a lot going on at once. playing for more than an hour gives me cramps in my hands and the constant fixing of camera and mis clicks makes me dread playing it sometimes\n",
      "ive played since 2.4 the game is good i dont really have much problems but its nice theres some problems sometimes that when you quest talk to other people it kinda glitches and it takes a lot of time to load. but mostly i recommend this game if you like rpg and nice characters the game is fun and the characters have amazing designs i really love this game hope you do more amazing updates in the future i really really recommend this game for you to play if you are bored.\n",
      "been playing this game ever since its release and always looking forward for new regions. i definitely want to play till the end of this game. graphics and designs are all gorgeous. pulling for characters i wanted is what i love in this game however the genesis crystal purchase is too expensive. more than a hundred dollar in my currency but not even 1 pity 90 pulls . thats the only problem i have with the game so far. it makes me want to spend less honestly.\n",
      "the storyline is just amazing. this is quite one of the best games i ever played in a while the characters have a amazing design with a amazing backstory. the map is big with everything to explore the bosses have a great design and an amazing attacks overall this is a amazing game. recommended edit hoyoverse if you see this theres a problem when i join the game. it kicks me out everytime i need to join the game please fix it if possible.\n",
      "great game playing on my a52 it plays great. update after playing for over a year its a beautiful game with amazing graphics and movement. great story and soundtrack. however it can get boring at times when there isnt any events or when youve caught up to the story. at most on a daily bases you have at best about 30 mins to and hr worth of play time if so much. the game needs end game content and needs to be more generous with its gacha.\n",
      "positive the game gets better with every update its hard to run out of things to do. however on the negative side the storage is ridiculous. ive had to delete so much off my phone to fit all of the updates and i know i wont be able to download sumeru when it releases in a couple of months. its really the only bad thing i have to say about the game other than the prices and lag. if you get the 90 bundle it doesnt even get you to max pity. plus even on the lowest graphics it lags a lot.\n",
      "at first i played just because of a friend but this game amazes me in so many ways. the intricate details in lore the gorgeous scenery the character designs the enemy design as well and the fighting system now with dendro introduced this game just keeps getting better and better.\n",
      "best game i have ever played its so fun to play. sometimes crashes and quality is not so good but despite that i have so much fun while playing this game. it takes lot of storage space so i havent played it for a while since i dont have sufficient storage storage space needed is too much for my device to process. last year my device had to go for repairing due to this game download. but it never gets boring i have been playing this game for about 2 years now..\n",
      "amazing character design game with the best lore amazing world building a really fun mechanic the graphic is top tier and i love the art style. the pity could be really frustrating sometimes specially when you lost your 50 50. but overall its one of the best game. p.s please give us a generous rewards for the 2nd annivs since the first annivs we only got few fate\n",
      "the game is beautiful the quality of story writing has improved recently. theres no questions for animation and music quality theyre top notch. some of the filler contents such as this summer event is very entertaining. however it should be noted that the game is unfinished and is created for casual gameplay. therefore it might become repetitive very quickly. another donwside to the game is the heavy grinding for in game mats thats rng based.\n",
      "the game is great. fantastic lore and story of each character the game mechanics is a bit boring since it only have two skills including burst thats literally in need of energy point to release with cooldown of around 15s and repeated attacks but theyre smooth so getting tired playing one four character repeatedly can be almost impossible and the minigames around the world is fine but the event is better and i hope some of them can stay forever.\n",
      "starting a new journey on a new map only in this recent update my frame rate suddenly freezes for 0.4 0.5 seconds every 3 seconds ive lowered my graphics a bit but it is still there plss look into this some tips to minimize or remove this short freezing characters movements are not catching up to what theyre currently saying a bit awkward right now \n",
      "love love love it changed my phone and the running is smoother than ever love all the graphics the audio the new characters the excitement im not a person to play hardcore rpg games on my phone but this is another level of fun it can be idle exciting exhilarating calm funny and everything all at the same time. loved it ever since i downloaded it last year never to be deleted \n",
      "when i try updating genshin for the sumeru update it says pending once i left my phone for 30 mins and when i came back it still said pending please fix this overal its a verry good game good graphics and love the character designs i also love the lore and little stories its verry detailed and also love the cutscenes there is some lag and sometimes i get kicked out of the game for no reason so maybe try to fix that 3\n",
      "i liked the game really but the thing is when everytime i used my burst to fight mobs slimes hilichurls etc its health bar kept disappearing i could only see it if i used a burst or a different angle but it disappeared after which makes my gaming experience harder especially when im currently using mobile to play the game it doesnt apply bosses since theyre health bar is on top of the screen instead of being on top of its head like the mobs please fix this issue thank you 3\n",
      "im at an extremely dull phase not even remotely excited for sumeru and the end game and quality of life is still non existent. content is getting so boring and theres zero challenge or stimulation. i wish the developers would listen to the players. i have no reason to continue buying the battle pass all my characters are maxed out and theres 0 customization. i have 0 reasons to play with friends and i feel like the competition has better rewarding exploration. you need to level up \n",
      "still the best game for me but as time goes by it gets boring doing all the things repeatedly just to upgrade things that takes time to gain. its a bit difficult i get burnout and stop playing for days game break and go back to same scene again. upgrading things makes me want to sleep instead.\n",
      "from my experiences this game is actually pretty good a lot of fun. i find it beautiful and interesting. i like the open world feature and the story. theres just one problem that i encountered sometimes when i open the app the hoyoverse intro pops up but nothing else after that. i cant open the game. the only way i could open again is to reinstall and it is such a pain to wait for the update to finish but other than that the game is really good. i hope you will fix it soon.\n",
      "ive been playing this game for almost one year and i dont miss on playing it everyday. first of all the story is really awesome and the scenery of this game is top tier. its been one year and im still mesmerized with the scenery sometimes when im bored im just running when doing commission to appreciate the scenery and the music is so beautiful.\n",
      "the open world concept truly makes me feel like im traveling inside the game itself . the lore characters the music and everything about this game is awesome genshin is mostly single player but you can choose to play multi at your own convenience . the updates are regular coming at every 6 weeks . but yeah if youre considering to be f2p then just know this ... the rewards system is not that great and youll need a lot of self control t t . all in all imo its a great game 3\n",
      "played since launch and its my favorite game extremely good story character design 5 drops are good compared with other gatchas because theres a guarantee and i love the map exploration. the only problem is the 1st aniversary rewards they were not good anough even though they were redone it still wasnt enough still hoping for good rewards on 2nd anni\n",
      "the good good game addictive fun good characters and nice graphics the combat system is fun and the animations are cool the gacha is ok but free prymogems are hard to grind. the bad censorship sucks progression system is too slow resin system is very limited and the artifact grinding is annoying and tiring any other grinding is just like any other gacha but again resin is hard to get and slow to recharge.\n",
      "its a amazing game it has outstanding graphics and its entertaining because you always have something to do but the one problem i have is that it takes a long long long long time to download things i dont care about how hard the pulls are thats how the game works but im just a little impatient about downloading stuff so thats my only complain otherwise its the best game ive played yet \n",
      "this game is an absolute masterpiece the music the artstyle the storyline everything its just too perfect. i really hope they add a cross save feature through servers in the future so i could play with my friends in another nation without losing progress.\n",
      "my journey through teyvat has been great tho i experience some few bugs before like when an enemy is almost dead the health comes back and then when fishing bar is already full it still goes on but it doesnt really bother me because it only happens sometimes but i hope you can fix it in version 3.0 goodluck grinding again everyone \n",
      "the game is very high quality in presentation the level of polish exceeds almost all mobile games and can even be compared to console titles. the downfall would be the rest of the game gameplay as well as the mechanics. it may be unique but ends up tedium filled in the long term.\n",
      "the game is totally worth it. amazing graphics characters and game play. i only owe to point out that the game needs all of my devices storage. other than that i encourage the developers to keep doing the amazing work theyve been doing for the past years \n",
      "i love this game ive been playing since june of 2021 and ive loved it since then. my only problem is how much storage it takes up especially if your a mobile player like myself and sometimes it wont work and will kick me off the app after i got a new phone. but those are my only two complaints the game itself is super fun great characters amazing story line and you can play with other people too. truly my favorite game \n",
      "genshin impact is a really good game. i immediately liked it when i started playing. i like the graphics the character designs the gameplay and the functions of the game. i just hope that we can clip sink and float objects in the serenitea pot. the serenitea pot allows players to be creative and make their own ideas and i hope that we can be more free about it. nevertheless the game is probably one of the best games that ive ever played \n",
      "the graphic and storyline was great but one thing. i install this game to have fun not to think hard. some events really need you to think hard so i dont really like it. i dont know with other players whose have brilliant iq but for a normal human as me i cant follow the events well\n",
      "i enjoy the game alot but elemental reactions and the buffs are a bit confusing sometimes and my characters are kinda weak for my world level but overall its one excellent game. it could be more better if the amount of storage it takes up would be less. it would be better if they made this game on more devices nintendo switch etc. .\n",
      "constant updates fast bug fixes interesting story and great characters. i still play this daily and i really enjoy all the events. theres some things that are kind of iffy like the ratio of 5 to 4 more 4 characters please several layers of rng and the ratio of male to female characters much more females among some other things but i am hoping theyll get addressed in the future updates.\n",
      "its a great app i have played genshin for about a year and i still loved it just as much when i started. it is hard to collect premogems when u are f2p so its very tempting to spend money witch i have and do not regret its fun entertaining and has a great story line. its a casual game so if u grid it to much u can become burnt out or board. but i would 10 10 recommend this. its so addictive in a good way bc u can explore all the lore and different storys as well as hot characters. \n",
      "i love it i almost play it everyday. you can choose graphic quality change the voice line into other languages all the character is cool somethings basics and more but..the problem is that when i wanna fight or go on adventures sometimes it start to get lag and i got out of the game for no reasons and i hope you will release venti banner... ehe . thats all \n",
      "i really love this game and have been playing since day one. i really love all the characters and the designs. the co op system is really nice and fun so you can play with friends however it sound be updated and improved because it can be a lot better. really awesome combat system. its graphics are absolutely stunning. i cant wait for more \n",
      "game is fun. but the game does not want me to play with new characters. acquiring a character is very expensive unless you choose to skip many. and after acquiring it takes weeks to be able to get them up to the level of my other characters. i just want to play with the new exciting stuff ... but i cant until i do the required farming. this isnt a game its a job\n",
      "very amazing. for a mobile game this this pack a lot of things. truly amazing. but i put 4 star because 1. swapping character during combat is unintuitive due to the fact that only three slot were shown. this make the order jumbled 2. the lip sync wont be soo hard to be fixed. considering the amount of revenue this game have. i wont be surprised if a whole software were develop to make the lip sync with each different languages other than that this game is amazin\n",
      "the gameplay story characters graphics soundtracks were all amazing it was very entertaining one of the best games ive ever played but it would be really great if you add a feature where you can replay finished archon quests or story quest.\n",
      "an incredible open world game with beautiful characters landscapes and ost that runs well on mobile but as someone who plays for the combat levelling and exploration aspects of this game the ludicrous amounts of dialogue that i have to sift through in order to progress and unlock new areas look i know this is a story driven game but it wouldnt hurt to add a button that skips dialogue which 90 of games in this genre have sadly ruins it for me.\n",
      "this game is fantastic i am ar 45 who keep making new acc i well like to give some idea can you please add an option where you can skip the whole dialogue cutscene that will make the game much faster for those player who keep making an acc and getting impatient because of how long the cutscenes dialogoe there is also a problem where it get glitchy on some cutscenes maybe because my phone is low device can you try and find a way to fix it ty.\n",
      "so far so good a bit laggy sometimes but overall its good. the only problem is that it randomly kicks me out of the game i dont know why my internet is fine and my phone could manage it well yet it just kicks me out randomly. its getting a bit more annoying especially when im actually getting into the story.\n",
      "i really love this game and it has been able to run on my chromebook. though recently it kept crashing before i could even see the pyro icon turn gray. ive checked for missing files cleared the cashe for the game and even unintalled and re installed it. ive also restarted my chromebook a multitude of times yet nothing has been able to work. im not sure if this a problem on my part but i would like if this issue could be resolved.\n",
      "overall its a great experience. enjoyed the game for a while till it gets a bit repetitive. the game has a really huge map to explore including time limited maps with beautiful landscapes. the music and character designs are amazing the resin system and the gacha rates are pretty underwhelming.. and yeah thats all..\n",
      "its really fun you can play with your friends and explore theres also a lot of fun events and it gives a lot of primogems i am also excited about the new sumeru update. but sadly i cant see ice damage grass and elemental reactions. i hope you can fix this bug because a lot of players also experience this.\n",
      "im playing genshin for about half a year now and all i can confirm is that the graphics are beautiful the first stories like the mondstadt and liyue archon and side quests were really entertaining when i first experienced them. the character designs and mechanics of each one is sort of easy to comprehend but an average person can understand enough to get by. id also like to say how i dislike how low the resin cap which is a pretty big issue and how the teapot function has limits like load.\n",
      "i absolutely love it this game is really beautiful. its really fun you can do alot of things here. i really recommend this game. its really addicting you can interact with alot of travellers. you can collect alot of new characters its really great the map is so massive and theres alot of things to do you can attack creatures and other things edit could you also add a trading options for trading characters my friend really wants diona and i really want kuki shinobu lol. sumeru is out \n",
      "started recently and ive taken a good liking to it. so much to explore and not a boring experience at all. just one thing even at the lowest setting... i get frame drops. that maybe a regional problem. but otherwise love the game and the grind.\n",
      "no controller support for androids. that is the only disappointment. other than that its a good game and i play mainly on my pc rather than mobile because the mobile version is not really efficient and the play style is not great either which would be easier if i have a controller and i do except it doesnt support controller for androids which i think is unfair. if you have controller support for iphone why not androids as well.\n",
      "this game is such an amazing rpg game ive ever played..the graphics music scenery and the background effects are so awesome.. ill give you a 5 star..but can you fix the crash and the crit text ice bridge and grass for a potato phone because i already get the graphics to the highest one but still cant see the numbers and so on..also its so disturbing when i was playing coop with friends and suddenly it crashed..i already clear my storage caches and everything but still crashing like omg\n",
      "its really fun and addicting but one thing is that you have to have a really good device and alot of storage to be able to play it at all. alot of events and stuff to do you can be multiplayer and make friends which is nice. though one con for that is the friend limit needs to be higher. also really tempting to spend money on \n",
      "for a while now maybe 3 months or more my game has started freeze up out of nowhere even though i would have good internet. i already cleared out cache and uninstalled apps i no longer needed. i dont know what is causing the freeze up but can i have some advice on how to stop the freezing this hasnt happened before when i first started playing genshin. thank you.\n",
      "the game is really good. but the optimisation is a little bit bad because you really need a powerful phone to play it with nice graphics and good fps i have redmi note 8 phone and i cant get a stable 30 frams even at the lowest settings and thats annoying because i love the graphics of this game but thats the only issue a have everything else is perfect and i love it\n",
      "i like the game its great and i love it. but i have a huge problem with the graphics the graphics are fine. but for some reason whenever i want to talk pick up fight or even just run my screen always end up pausing it will play when i wait like 15 minutes or i restart but that is not everything. my wifi is good and its shows im on 50ms but it suddenly goes up to 200 even tho i just clicked sprint basically. also when i try to fight my game always pauses i like the app. pls fix.\n",
      "best game ever. i started playing this game back in may 5 2021 i fell in love with this game ever since. some suggestions though please add more options for both basic and advance graphical settings like an option to turn on or turn off grass animations or just remove the grass entirely make the graphics settings more separate so that we could go through the settings more deeper add the low shadows from the pc version and add ambient occlusion. thanks.\n",
      "the rank ascendsions shouldnt be so much of a frustration to just continue the storyline and seem to be a way of getting players to quit playing due to difficulty. dont get me wrong its a lovely game but to do thr storyline only for there to be places where adventure rank locks seems counterproductive when it is used to progress story\n",
      "a very good game with good graphics superb music and a wonderful story. however it is clear to me that the people working on this game have no intention of diversifying the character roster. hoyo continues to take from other cultures to inspire its nations and yet cannot go beyond 2 skin tones. this game would be much better if new characters had more skin tone diversity.\n",
      "why is there no gamepad support on mobile its been more than 2 years and still no controller support on android. seriously with all the money this game makes its unbelievable. i have a bluetooth controller for android and multiple xbox one controllers and i dont understand why they dont work for this game. seriously needs it. i have a s20 and even with such a big screen i find i accidentally jump when trying to attack or plunging when i was trying to stop gliding. its annoying.\n",
      "the game is really interesting its slow paced every important thing or feature is introduced slowly and overtime. the only issue i have with the game is the amount of space it uses. new updates always require huge amounts of space needed and that means i have to start deleting other app data or uninstalling apps to be able to update the game.\n",
      "i love this game really its amazing and i love following the story but the more i go into it the more glitchy and slow the game becomes and everytime i have to talk to a character it takes forever until it actually works and ive also fallen out of the world multiple times know and i dont even dare trying to teleport places anymore cause by the time i actually get to the place it wouldve been faster to just run there. if you dont have a really good phone dont bother downloading this game\n",
      "i love this game. its an adventure game with beautiful scenery an amazing storyline and cool combat. i like how you can make every choice your own even in npc dialogue. there is such a range of things you can do and i would highly recommend the game. it doesnt have ads but it requires wifi. the download update time is roughly 20 minutes depending on the size. i hope you enjoy the game and hope that my review helps. have a great day.\n",
      "i love the new place sumeru so much i found it accidentally and it was so cute and unique very nice design rounds of applauses to design team. anyway this game is perfect for f2p player who also love to explore the almost limitless open world i got diluc and some other great characters without a single in game purchases. keep up the great work \n",
      "the game is nice but whenever i quit the game and enter it again.. it downloads a new resources which i have to wait longer to get in to the game which its awful. like whenever i have to join to play with my friends it always download resources before playing. please solve this problem very soon i think im the only one having this glitch.\n",
      "i love the game its beautiful the story lines are amazing its brilliant. but honestly it takes up way too much space and takes way too long to download. its not even done yet and takes up half my storage. i feel like when its finished youll need nothing else on your phone but genshin impact just because of the storage needed. other than that i love the game\n",
      "the game is fantastic i never had this much fun they need to add more content. it takes them a while to add new content plus they need to add more different features to make it even more enjoyable for f2p players. one last thing they need to make the game more smoothly on mobile version.... the game is sometimes unplayable because of the lag. other than this is definitely one of the best games you can play on mobile.\n",
      "very fun game i only wish for more freemogems. the game updates frequently and it has plenty of events altho im still hoping for scaramouche to release lol it has a lot of nice charecters and the story and art is wonderful edit power creeping is kinda a issue and the rates are a but annoying btu other then that still highly recommend also hoyoverse we need more co op events. most of the fun stuff is from co op. \n",
      "its a really fun high quality and it doesnt lag much but i gave it a 4 star instead of 5 bec. its kinda confusing but after you get familiar with everything it it starts to become really addictive it does take up alot if storage and memory but its worth it regardless id say this game is awesome a top recommendation for sure \n",
      "this game is amazing i usually dont play games but this one is so diverse... it has amazing graphics but i can also interact with the environment like walking on freezing water and more... however i do experience lags from time to time... i hope that will be fixed in next updates... all recommendations for this game ps. i hope they will soon have linux support too \n",
      "i dont usually play this game as often as i do with other game but sometimes when i do play i usually do some side quests for awhile. although some of the main quests are kinda hard to complete so i could use some hints but other then that its a fun game and the character selection and their different abilities are interesting and sometimes useful.\n",
      "they added a new region and some strange quality of life upgrades. sumeru gives players a lit more things to do and that aranyaka quest takes hours to complete but it doesnt solve the overall underlying issue that genshin still doesnt have an endgame or difficult content. changes in the wish resin or artifacts randomizer systems would have been preferred instead of the wood collector thingy. contrarily dendro is an awesome element and seeing new game mechanics is absolutely phenomenal.\n",
      "i have enjoyed this game so much since then moment ive started playing. i play on both ps4 and mobile and it works so well. the game has amazing storyline game play and character design. the game is still in development however ive never experienced any bugs personally and have been playing for a bit. the game also works fairly well with bad wifi meaning it doesnt restrict many players from being able to play.\n",
      "ive been playing it for 2 years the game itself is fun. theres a lot to do in it from exploring to puzzle solving to quest lines that are part of the base game. then you have events that add more to the aforementioned stuff above. music is outstanding quite atmospheric. graphics are nice and pleasant to the eyes. unfortunately the rng that comes from the gacha system artifact type and stats plus the stamina function keeps this game from being a 5 star.\n",
      "the best game. its free and as an f2p player i didnt really experienced any inconveniences. it has good graphics an anime style game which is different from others. some say it as botw clone but when i played the game it didnt really felt like it is something like that. they both have a different art style they should know that before saying it.\n",
      "sumerus archon quest and lore are great theyre a time sink but they arent rushed and explain a lot of important stuff. i hope that more plot heavy stories can be permanent and not locked behind time limited events. as for the exploration in sumeru the entire region is fun to explore. its interesting and new but not annoying like inazuma. the main thing id criticise are the character designs. many of the characters dont feel accurate to the cultures that theyre inspired by.\n",
      "i absolutely love this game on the ps5 and mobile. though on the phone it can lag a little its nothing too serious. i truly recommend this game to those who like open world combative games. it has engaging storylines plenty of things to do while in between main storyline quests and amazing characters. the lore is fascinating and the combat itself is beautiful. the graphics are better on the ps but that doesnt mean that theyre bad on mobile. try it you will love it. you dont have to pay\n",
      "this game is visually and audibly pleasing to play. from smooth graphics to an immersive storyline and many relatable characters to love and adore this game is definitely one of a kind. the open world and free rain to explore between quests make it even more fun. definitely a top 5 game for me \n",
      "honestly one of the best rpg ever its got constant updates with fun events super cool characters each very unique super interesting lore the voice actors are amazing at what they do. the game also gives each player a chance to build characters however they want the scenary in the game is also beautiful. the only issues ive seen with the game is drop rates are too low and its pretty hard to get good artifacts but it still happens eventually u just gotta grind for good stuff. 100 recommend\n",
      " updated review thanks for reply. the main thing that i want to see in future that there should be a dedicated skip buttons for the dialogues and also the puzzles should be more specific and accurate because the recent puzzle is hard to solve due to not enough information about how to synchronise properly . please add some kinds of mount such as horse or a unicorn to explore more effectively. there should be some permanent events like the wind trace maybe you can add this in teapot .\n",
      "the game is fantastic and i love it with all my heart. but one thing i dont like personally is ascending characters. if you dont do it before your world level increases your screwed in a sense. i learned the hard way. but honestly i love everything about the game from the characters to the scenery. literally everything is beautiful and i feel so relaxed when playing.\n",
      "artifact rng in general is terrible but what i hate the most about it is the drops. allow us to choose what artifact set we want to get before farming the domain. imagine if this nonsense also happened with talent book domains i dont think anyone would even play this game. i cant count how many times i got the wrong set back to back all the other artifact rng is still terrible but this one frustrates me the most because its such a simple thing to fix.\n",
      "ever since the update its been super laggy.. after about an hour a half of playing it will just straight up freeze on my tablet. sometimes it just crashes. ive had to reopen the app twice now because regardless if im coop or solo it will freeze not respond. i really want to enjoy the game so its a bit disappointing. i hope they fix the issue soon. put it to 2 stars bcs it seems like the team at mihoyo dont bother to fix the issues that people complain about. just read the 1 reviews.\n",
      "while this game is amazing it has a few flaws for on chromebook dont get me wrong its a good game i have it on my phone but for chrombook its not that great first of all i spent over an hour trying to get past the intro. im still not past it due to immense amounts of lag the screen is also blank. i have no clue what happend either. another thing is on chrombook you should add pc controls or the option to change them instead of just having moble controls thanks \n",
      "great game for casual playong lots of fun storyline and activites in all stages of the game. some issues with graphics quality on mobile are present but they dont take away too much from the actual gaming experience. i would recommend this game to anyone who has around 30 40 minutes a day to play and is not prone to over playing or grinding as those two habits take away from the sense of adventure and fun in the game.\n",
      "its really great as a story the gameplay fells awesome the combat is amazing the fact that it has no ads is also a big win in them the gatcha is a bit annoying but i have managed to be able to clear many stuff as a f2p and speaking of f2p it being free means if you dont like it you dont lose much also pretty much every character is hot is a big win for me\n",
      "for newer players this game is really entertaining as it goes. though for late players or as your so called journey continues the more you play the more it gets a little bit stressful. then it adds up and adds up to the point were theres no other interesting content to be a involved in. this may not be for everyone but a really huge majority of the players either quit the game or not play for a while. this is because their is literally nothing interesting do after beating the game.\n",
      "by far the best gacha rpg ive ever played. amazing graphics and scenarios irntesting lore and characters exellent music and va all languages ive tryed them all . the artefacts system is well balanced although it can get a bit frustraiting at times and the gacha system in one of the best. the events are super fun and have good rewards. only problem is that playing on mobile can potentially ruin the experience since the game could lag a lot . but thats not their part so definitely 5 5\n",
      "the game itself if great. but its annoyingly cruel is youre a good sniper. even if you got a character from far away their health just regenerates. the battle only counts when youre in the enemies range not the other way around. also there waaaay too much dialogue in the story. like waaaay too much rambling by characters.\n",
      "exploring sumeru has a lot of issues like it lags the area becomes blurred i cant teleport to anywhere is it just me or teleportation becomes unavailable once im in sumeru and this just happens in sumeru and nowhere else. but otherwise the game is sooo good this is the first time im addicted to a game in a long time and i rarely play games. the story is addicting you always yearn to know what will happen next especially with finding our sibling.love the game.would totally recommend it.\n",
      "you can finish your dailies under 20 minutes and then explore the world or level up your characters. its like being part of your favorite show. every region is like a new season of the show and the lore and stories of characters are very nice. my only complaint is the combat targeting system with normal attacks elemental skills and elemental burst. i sometimes want to ignore the enemies or strategise in harder content like spiral abyss i might want to target an enemy.\n",
      "a really well thought through game great graphics and lots of stuff to do battle and unlock the only downside is that is uses alone of charge but its a really good quality game 5 stars for sure ive had no glitches or problems in game play i hope you like the game too \n",
      "good game but for new players they can be locked out of most current and upcoming events due to being level requirements and story requirements. still have alot of issues and some characters have problems that has still not been fixed for 2 years and some being minor not being fixed. good game but the company isnt great at managing the games current state for endgames and new players.\n",
      "i love this game so much.everything about it is great but personally i dont like the adventure rank ascensions because ive been stuck on the first one and i cant beat the domain. ive done it about 10 times and i cant beat the electro hypnostasis even with help from videos and i just want to do the archon quests ect. and some players believe its too hard.\n",
      "the combat of the game is engaging and enjoyable however theres not enough. if something like labyrinth warriors was turned to a permanently playable mode then the game would get more recognition and would keep players wanting to play. for veteran players there is nothing to do and the players may drop the game especially with other game releases. the perilous trail event would be close to perfection if it was permanent and the game would truly be 5 ... hopefully not limited though.\n",
      "it is a very well executed game theres so many characters and stuff the story itself is very interesting. tho when youre using phone its rather grassless...and low quality theres also no numbers of the total hit you have done i got heizou and whenever i do his ultimate the bar of the monsters or whoever i am fighting dissappears. well although it is like that i enjoy the game you should download it \n",
      "this game is definitely trying to make you spend money on it and people who are free to play like me are definitely getting the shaft in a few ways but overall this game has improved in a variety of ways. the exchange rates of real money to in game characters items and currency are still atrocious. worth your time not your wallet.\n",
      "since the desired artifacts are difficult to obtain i think that hoyoverse should create a system where we are allowed to reset the artifacts that have been upgraded from level 20 to level 1 again this will make it easier for us to obtain the appropriate stats for each character. i really like this game and have been playing since patch 2.0 i hope this game continues to grow successfully.\n",
      "beautiful game. played from the beginning still the best cross platform game of all time. the music graphic character scenery combat story gameplay animation everything is just perfect. they also outdid themself on every update. 10 10. thank you hoyoverse \n",
      "this game is one of my favorites and way back when i pretty much played none stop but now im doing other things and sometimes when i do have a chance to go on it doesnt work 100 mostly in multiplayer mode it mostly just glitches out here and there time to time. but overall this game is my favorite and probably will always be my favorite i may one day make another account to restart for fun but wholl know anyways i highly recommend playing this game with or without firends bye \n",
      "i like the concept of the game alought and the characters are very fun to use. my only problem with it is the fact that once your character has reached level 20 it becomes very difficult to try and ascend to higher levels. kind of wish that the level up system in the game would have no requirements just using what you find and improving them without the need of ascension . other than that games amazing.\n",
      "this game is a 10 10 with story telling and the graphics look beautiful i dont even know what to say it is truly amazing and each time ive gotten a new account for co op stuff i see the very start of the game again and im so blown away also the mobile version is as easy to use as pc which i appreciate so much as someone with an old slow pc it is so easy to have fun in this game world quests make the world so much more alive the general story is beautiful and emotional amazing.\n",
      "the game really know how to impress me. i really love the world exploration as well as other ingame feature such as the housing system. not forget to mention there are lots of fun event eventhough they are limited time event like the windtrace hide and seek and theater mechanicus tower defense . i really hope the dev team can bring back those event. although the game could use some improvement as there is not a lot to do for endgame player since the content is limited.\n",
      "ive been playing genshin impact from version 2.6. everything was fine. i loved everything of the game. but after the 3.0 update the game often suffers crashes. the game never crashed before. its suddenly crashing a lot. please fix this problem.\n",
      "love it i can spend hours playing this game and still not get bored. i highly recommend the side quests you will need to build your ar up for the story quests but even the side quests are fun and can get a bit stressful at times as well. it has a good mix of both. absolutely hate dragonspine but the quests there are so much fun and the ruin guards will be the death of me one of these days. lol. but once i pick this game up i dont want to put it down.\n",
      "if you have a game that you want to grind. this game is great for its fighting combat system and characters. its pretty grind based and it takes a long time just to get a 10 pull. since there are many characters youll have to wait for the characters you want because they have to rerun. the biggest problem is the storage because it takes up a lot of storage. 16gb for this game. as more regions release its gonna take up more space and since some mobile players have barely enough storage.\n",
      "game is great really pc level of gameplay and enjoyment on mobile. sadly this game has huge problems such as horrible rng artifact system awful wishing system bugs not being fixed even a year after launch bad balancing between characters and non interesting endgame gameplay. by the time youve finished up the story quests you might as well wait another year for new story quests. with that being said its fun factor is unlike any game ive played on mobile.. so i guess it deserves 5 stars..\n",
      "i played since itto was released and during my stay in here im going to give it a 5 star because the storylines the characters the rewards the graphics it really is like another world the rewards are a bit dissatisfaction but overall its good sadly i fear that i would stop playing in the future since the updates storage are getting bigger and my phone wont be able to catch up ill get a latop soon by the way to those who wants to try this i highly encourage you to do so its very fun \n",
      "fantastic this game is actually very well made. itll definitely keep you hooked and coming back for more. so far i havent experienced any advertisements or the game forcing me to buy something in order to move forward. the graphics look great and the game runs very smoothly. highly recommend to anyone looking for an adventure rpg. initial download will be very large so do it over wi fi.\n",
      "this game is thoroughly enjoyable especially since you get enough incentives to continue playing as a free to play player and are not forced to pay for advancement. this is the first time i have willingly put some money into a game because im so impressed with the graphics soundtrack and overall gameplay.\n",
      "best game in the play store. this is an actual game not like other games in the play store either very simple or monetizing your time through ads . everything is amazing the story character design music and world building. the world in the game is vast and beautiful. and the best part is that you can play as much as you want. you dont have to wait for stupid things in the game to recharge so you can play like stamina... in short yes download the game i promise you will not regret it.\n",
      "the game is absolutely astonishing . first the game offers a massive world to explore and so many quests and objectives that it is impossible to get bored while playing there is always tons of stuff to do. second it is true that being a free to play player isint easy ive been playing the game for about 1.5 years currently ar 43 but it doesnt mean that the game is anything but pure entertainment and fun. thank you mihoyo for this great game and continuous updates.\n",
      "a quality free to play experience even at late game. ive been fairly lucky with pulls so fortunately i have a few good characters to pick from what i lack is good weapons. even with that said i clear everything so you really dont need to spend money on this game and unlike most mobile titles this is actually a game. beautiful world amazing soundstage great voice acting lovely diversity of character to collect passable story. works well on mobile but better on pc console. ganyu 10\n",
      "in my opinion this game is the best rpg ive played in a long time and thats a lot coming from me because i play a lot of rpg games this game has all kinds of monsters to fight while still giving you the chance to follow the main story line you dont get stuck in the story if you get bored theres different quests and things to find. overall the game is great and i totally recommend the only issue is it takes up a lot of space so its hard to pay it often did to not enough space\n",
      "absolutely gorgeous the game itself has amazing lore characters and interesting designs. not to mention the world itself its so pretty tho sometimes it lags from time to time i just lower some graphics to make it smoother with render. also its free to play you can pay to get new characters from a gacha wish banners but i suggest to just be patient and have fun playing \n",
      "amazing game loads to explore and do and every update there is something new to do and updates come out every 6 weeks. however the gacha system is awful even though it is possible to get new characters free to play it requires either a lot of luck or a lot of money it also suffers from not having much to do in the end game where nothing posses a challange and getting new characters is much harder. overall its an amazing game but would be much better if it wasnt for the gacha system\n",
      "this game is absolutely amazing and astonishing. i would recommend it to those who want to explore and not just be forced by the story to progress. there a some downside the summon are low and the fragment to get them for free are hard as well. so if u want to spend some money you can but its not required\n",
      "the storyline is simply amazing the heroes design could be slightly better as well as the colors. the gameplay is really fun exploring is fun as hell. i really enjoy grinding even though some people call it boring. overall 9 10 nothing is perfect.\n",
      "this game is perfect i cant describe my words are too long. i like the english it thought me lot of new vocabulary. i like the graphic music characters story. the only thing dv should add is little tutorial or bigger hint for some puzzles theyre sometimes confusing even more to newbies\n",
      "this game is an absolute masterpiece it is so addictive and fun to play but theres is one problem that is annoying me. as a player who plays on mobile i experienced glitches on the appearances of the bosses it took me ages to pass the quest confront stormterror but i finally beated it yesterday and was overjoyed. but that feeling didnt last long as the new villian bosss appearance was also glitched. this disappointed me i hope it can be fixed. atleast childes appearance is ok lol.\n",
      "genshin is a great game the story line character design etc... ofc some monsters are to strong in my opinion like the old geovishap. but i gotta say it lags often on phone even when you turn all the setting options on the lowest or its just my phone . i still love the game and i will keep playing r.i.p storage \n",
      "this is a great game that was made not just for profit but for the purpose of a fun and enjoyable experience. there are micro transactions but everything can be unlocked without spending a penny. my only complaint is the game has performance issues on mobile devices even on the latest models it still has lag on high graphics settings. other than that its a good game its well made and its fun to play.\n",
      "the game itself is perfect the story is interesting and others the game mode is also interesting. but for an example a problem when i started playing i got kujou sara in the gacha system but her ascension materials are in inazuma this makes person get the character stuck in a certain level. like imagine that someone starts playing the 7 nations are released and the person gets one character from the last nation the person really wont be able to use the character.\n",
      "oustsanding music fit in their respective environment. relaxing graphics makes me come back to this game now and then. damage mechanics quite unique and also lot of puzzles to solve. second game absolutely first game kinda boring once you reach end game. but events worth to come back to.\n",
      "the update is great the atmosphere and music are just great in sumeru a lot of new features that are really helpful in exploring althou there are minor bugs like sometimes mobs guarding a chest disappears but its an easy fix if you restart the game the new chracters have a really good design and the story has been pretty great so far. a great update indeed.\n",
      "id rate this game a solid 3.5 5 all things considered its super fun and i love the art and graphics combat and story. one issue with this game is the paywall you shouldnt have to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars to fully unlock a five star and c6 them and you shouldnt have to spend hundreds on a weapon banner just to get the weapon you want. the other issue is they are way too slow at releasing story quests for a company profiting millions off their game.\n",
      "surprising amount of content for a free game. so much exploration events every month engaging lore and likeable and interesting characters. the only problem with the mobile version is how intense it is on performance this is one of those battery drainer games. but i highly reccomend the game for the 100s of hours of content.\n",
      "this is a wonderful game with beautiful graphic and lore. much for a new player to do and discover. only probably i have are the controls. theyre to large and very sensitive. it would be nice to choose the size style and sensitivity of the control. overall i love this game\n",
      "good polished game and sets a new standard. but gets really repetitive. events feels more like another amusement park you have visited before. many things are simply recycled from assets that exists from launch for example character animations used in new story cutscenes are obviously old ones. it feels very amateurish and low budget even source film maker creators put more effort than this. developers have gained their money already and seems to change their focus to the new projects.\n",
      "superb game i ever played in my life. story line up in the game was insane. literally it was awesome in any category graphics characters the way of adventures done by the traveller sounds and music weapons .. etc but actually i am expecting that to change the data of the user to any other server manually by request because it will definitely help us to play even with other server players by connecting them with the game. i hope may be in future they will think about it. \n",
      "its great however when i test the game on tablets mobile phones it crashes. i know that phones and tablets arent the best for genshin but whatever mostly i have to clear the cache for it to stop crashing as said on google how to fix tablet crash on genshin impact . overall great game and cool characters although i suggest u make more easier ways to get intertwined fate and more primogems it could be a struggle for lower adventure rank players a result of wanting their first five star.\n",
      "its an amazing game but i do have some complaints its pretty hard to get your ar to rank up almost everything that isnt the story is rng based and most character people want are only available for a limited run making it really hard to get. and it takes alot of storage on mobile some ways i think this game could improve is to make all characters added to the standard banner and make there banner just a higher chance of getting them and to reduce the size of the game on mobile\n",
      "great game. i love playing and the daily commissions story quests archon quests etc are enjoyable. the scenery is beautiful and every region is unique. new stuff comes out every month or so and the game doesnt get boring. i like the story and the objectives are clear. character and boss designs are great. although a way of playing events youve missed would be amazing \n",
      "i love this game everything about it is excellent sometimes certain things like controls are hard to understand. but im a beginner to gaming so thats expected i have a friend to help and there are lots of info in the game as well that helps this is one of the best games i have ever seen its one of my favorites \n",
      "this game is very fun and interesting. the combat part is fantastic reactions are fun story is solid music is awesome graphics and details are very beautiful and realistic. would 10 10 recommend to play this game. however you guys can increase the resin cap for quick collection of boss materials and artifacts.\n",
      "stepping into genshin impact i wasnt sure quite what to expect but as i played more i quickly fell in love with the game and began enjoying it thoroughly. i was hesitant on the multiple character switching in the beginning but the mechanic quickly grew on me. i thoroughly am enjoying this game and it is an amazing game for a mobile experience. there is plenty of hours of content available please add controller support for android as it would help a ton keep up the amazing work \n",
      "whenever the camera is turned it sometimes goes into a fullscreen blue for no apparent reason. also whenever theres a full connection on wifi it still stays in the range of 430 999 ping. it better be something on your side cuz ive quadruple checked if it was something on my side.\n",
      "i love the game have been playing it since realise but i gotta put 4 stars cuz of the small rewards storage and heating the processor on my phone which causes the game to lag and crash. also when im fighting bosses the game crashes and it says system ui isnt responding so i tested on other games to see if the cause is bcs of my phone samsung s22 but it only happens in genshin\n",
      "i have been playing genshin for more than a year now and do really love this game but at the same time i feel bad for new players because the challenges are too hard and confusing because of this the game is not enjoyable anymore with the comeback of golden archipelago in version 2.8 i really expected it to be just like the one in version 1.6 but no this one is not even fun everything is too confusing and complicated. so genahin if ure reading fix you puzzles especially the raven one.\n",
      "i really love this game especially its map and its characters i really hope that you know that i really love this game. this game is one of the things that can help me forget with stress and the problems from the outside world. seeing the characters i owned makes me really happy to see them. make sure to improve your security and the rng for artifacts. thank you so much for making this game\n",
      "starting to take up too much space on phone with each update. mhy needs to do better with developing the mobile platform separately from pc and ps platforms. pc is held back due to mobile incapabilities yet mobile is just getting bulkier to the point i cant update. i literally wouldnt mind the cut backs on mobile as pc is the better experience anyway when i play. i just want to quickly access from phone for quick tasks\n",
      "the only game i did not uninstall on my phone. been playing for almost year now and im constanstly in awe of how much effort and budget is being thrown into this very f2p friendly game. the lore the world building is incredible for a mobile game. of course it would pale in comparison to other pc games. like obviously it would but for someone like me who cant spend hours just leisurely playing games gi is worth it as you dont need to spend so much time on it in order to advance.\n",
      "been playing for awhile its a great game definitely recommend if you have enough storage. theres so many things you can do from fighting cool monsters unlocking new stories new areas along teyvat and fun events. the one thing that i wish could be changed is that you can move your data to a different server delete only one account instead of both if on one gmail. other than that its definitely worth a try. d\n",
      "as of now the state of the game isnt really changed. many days had passed and its still the same old genshin even the battlepass isnt changed and its almost 2 years. i dont really know what to say but all the updates are only for stories characters and weapons and not for the improvement of the game and the enjoyment of the players who seeks excitement through gaming everyday. its just a simple routine everyday and its fine for me since i dont have much time but for others it isnt.\n",
      "the maps characters and story line is amazing all the regions are so beautiful and fun to explore. i love the lore and story the character designs are so creative and makes all of them fun to play. i only wish there were more playable characters that had darker skin colors.\n",
      "wonderful game. insane graphics and were allowed to explore in feeto explore in free time it is amazing. my problem is the struggle to log in. im even scared that i may have lost my account now and might not play again if you leave the app and you come back in its like time reversed by a few seconds and i have to repeat what i had used done\n",
      "like so many others i enjoyed this game open world combat and storytelling not to mention the graphics look crisp the only problem i think i have is how hard it is to get the items needed to draw for items and new characters. if you could help me out there id appreciate that.\n",
      "good graphics characters no glitches fun to play hilarious moments nice story mode good side quests good story side quests i just love everything about it. no problems with this game you dont necessarily have to buy in game purchases to play the game its really good for what it is. safe for kids too no swearing in it.\n",
      "this game is very beautiful the characters the landscapes it has a strong story once you get into the game you wont get out of it but the size of the game is very large with this latest update it is almost 20 gb and i have a phone with 8 gb ram but the phone still heats up and sometimes lags. in general there is no problem and it runs very smoothly most of the time\n",
      "i absolutely adore this game the graphics are a and the story is intriguing in its own right i literally play this game every day its an addiction at this point haha but seriously the only danger of this game is that youll develop a dependence on it... well and it can make your phone pretty hot and drain battery. but for a game this amazing i think its worth it. it takes a lot of space so its better played on a gaming pc. just keep that in mind. great job hoyolab \n",
      "ive had a consistent issue on mobile where when i want to chat it glitches and doesnt let me its very inconvenient when im trying to communicate with players that randomly join my world. ive also been having an issue recently where when i farm artifacts my game will randomly spike and go to 999ms and just load until i fail the challenge. also lag is a really big issue sometimes. all of that aside i do love the game i just wish these issue could be fixed.\n",
      "this game is great it just needs three things 1 add sleeping emotes and beds by which we can pass the night . 2 add eating and drinking actions there must be two options eat and drink while pause or eat and drink with food or drink in the characters hand. 3 add wearable items to the game so we can decorate our character. thats all if you are adding this in the next update then thank you very much keep up the good work \n",
      "used to love the game until they added useless 5 stars that now outnumber the 4 stars and endless dialogues for the main story and events... if youre a busy person good luck catching up on those. whenever i attempt to catch up or try to join an event the dialogue is just too long i end up closing the game. please atleast add a skip button for dialogues so more players like me will feel encouraged to get back in the game. then ill rate this a 5 star.\n",
      "the game has everything u can be looking for in a game. its puzzles really develop your creativity. the main story is just too good and so exciting. moreover the characters are freaking awesome and i love how he devs sometimes listen to the players. its really nice. i cannot recommend this game enough...\n",
      "ok. as a player that has played since 1.8 i have no qualms. although as a low spender if the welkin moon and battle pass were slightly lower in cost i would definitely buy them. its just slightly overpriced in my opinion. but nevertheless i really enjoy a lot of the aspects in the game especially the music \n",
      "this game is amazing it has amazing storyline well designed characters. however it is worth spending money on and from time to time you can gamble on artifacts and wishing. but for me sometimes the game crashes and it doesnt respond. so i have to re login and stuff. besides that this game deserves a 4 star.\n",
      "eh. its alright. for a free game at least. the lore and characters are both very well writtena and are super interesting but unfortunately the storytelling in the game itself is absolute garbage. they spend the entire quest doing absolutely nothing relevant and then at the end they just make a cutscene with a twinge of uh.. emotion in it. like the chasm for example great concept awful delivery. hoyo nobody wants to play a boring game. hire better writers im sure you have the money.\n",
      "the start of this game i think is extremely strong. however when youve been playing as long as me which is since nov 2020 the game gets increasingly boring as u do similar quests or events for a few of the currency to pull characters. i do like this game its very polished and has rlly good design overall no doubt. one thing that ofc needs some improvement is end game. the only end game content is abyss and that already is quite basic. enemies are rarely changed in abyss.\n",
      "this is the best anime fighting game ive ever played i love all the detail and all the characters. the only thing i wish that would be added is mounts because of the time limit for sprinting. speaking of the time limits i wish that you had longer for some of them and on the gliding one you should be able to fly as long as you want.\n",
      "genshin is my absolute favourite game. the main story line is incredible and even the side stories are impeccable. the graphic is amazing and the sceneries are breathtaking. the quests can be hard but they give you a round of adrenaline. honestly think genshin deserves way more appreciation. i was so lucky to find a free game like this. props to those who made it and waiting for more updates.\n",
      "lately my game always reconnects to the server even though my ping is okay. the worst part is when i do some quests and the game starts to reconnect to the server i have to start all over again from the beginning even worst when im in the spyrall abbsy . mihoyo please fix my issue as soon as possible.\n",
      "the game is addictive and very good. the characters are great and the story is amazing. the problem with the game is that materials for leveling your characters are too hard to come by. when you level up in adventure rank the people you fight level up as well. i dont think they should level up from adventure rank because now i have two heroes leveled up to 70 and my enemies are at 72. its ridiculous because getting the material was hard and all of my heroes arent level 72 because materials.\n",
      "so heres the problem. take it from a gamer. its not meant for phones. playing on pc or console its amazing. my only issue with this game is the fact of developer locking character progression and even the characters themselves behind massive money pay walls. this game is great enough not to have to do that. customizations with character outfits i get. even weapon customizing with looks. but locking progression and trying to force a games length is terrible. few other things but this is main one\n",
      "this game was extremely fun. amazing game play beautiful graphics and astonishing story. if you asked me a month ago i would have given this game a 5 star. but the problem is is i broke my phone and when i got it replaced i logged on excited to finally get back to building my characters i had just gotten xiao and i found out that all of my progress was deleted. i was so upset because i spent almost 7 months playing\n",
      "generally ok game. there has been alot of glitches and bugs recently. its not letting me switch characters i have to keep tapping and maybe 10 seconds later it finally switches. then theres another glitch that doesnt let me do any damage but maybe a few seconds later all the damage symbols show up and cause a bunch or damage. same thing happens with healing puzzles and almost everything in the game. its getting really annoying and unplayable. also the graphics tanked... its blurry chunky.\n",
      "best game ever the graphics has left me gasping on multiple occasions not to mention the animations or the fact that you get the determine the actions of your chosen character and even play in the worlds of your friends. all you need even is internet and an 16 ar.i absolutely love the story line and the fact that ever major character even side ones as far as i can see have their own stories and backgrounds that i can get to know. therefore in my not so humble opinion this game is the greatest\n",
      "i really love this app even tho it crashes a lot in my phone. it has good quality graphics and i really love it. and also why the damage number wont show up whenever i fight with enemies . i hope they can fix the crashes too. but overall its a good game.\n",
      "i used to grind genshin alot and it was a good game. i would play it whenever i was bored and played with friends too but recently i had to get my computer shipped so i never got the chance to play its been a month since ive played and my whole data and account got wiped and reset. i lost everything my levels weapons characters and storyline got wiped. i was at adventure rank 32 and now its been reset to 1. i later read about the issues and found out that if you dont play it will get reset\n",
      "fun game but its a bit painful if youre free to play let alone putting any less then 10 dollars a month. update so the more i play this with friends the more i notice a flaw this game doesnt seem to really address. there is almost no incentive to play with others. unless youre being carried though a domain or a event is going on you really have no reason to do so. maybe a increase in drop rate amounts with a increase in difficulty for domains when in multi player would give you a reason..\n",
      "if i could remake this game myself i would but id really only change problems with artifact rng and character obtaining methods. other than that id probably redesign a boss or two but thats about it. maybe there are a few things id change otherwise but i cant really list them right now. overall pretty good game chool character designs and stories. toxic loud minority fanbase especially on twitter but i mean its twitter what do you expect.\n",
      "im really satisfied with all the music background and the graphics play style and even the settings is great. the only thing that im not really happy about the gacha system. i grinded primogems to pull for characters but everytime its more than 76 pity. however everything else is pretty much great and i cannot compain about anything.\n",
      "great game overall. only issue is that the quests and events are different than before. more on talking and puzzles with so many dialogue. wish they would put a skip button for hangouts and long dialogues since i do my sisters commission and it has been a problem ever since. also because theres not really much to do and if i do its always resin and side quests thats very long.\n",
      "the storyline is stunning just like the views you get to experience character design and combat animations are amazing but when it comes to gacha well wishing its absurd how in 6 10 pulls i only got 2 new characters and amber the single pulls only give you weapons at this point. im also from the eu but because of texture problems pretty much every where esp on stormterror i had to abandon my ar 30 and switch to asia where the textures work for some reason \n",
      "its hard finding games like this. i really love the work u guys put into it but story progression is weak and exploring and having op weapons is like a big thing in this game. i feel like im falling beind some games let u pass all of this and enjoy the story which i love but if i have to level up two or three times then i would have more luck playing assassins creed odyssey. i got rid of the game but if u guys change this and add some customization to the orginal character i would install again\n",
      "enjoyable ... if anyone has issues playing this game then your phone isnt up to the task when it comes to running it simply put buy a new phone or play on lowest graphic settings the amount of apps you have installed also causes lag so take your phones ram into account. i have a samsung a23 running on lowest graphic settings 45fps and no issues other than a random lag due to the games interior information being generated while im simultaneously playing it.\n",
      "amazing game. although the rewards arent very good i love the plot and all the plot twists throughout the story however i dont like how long it takes to go to places you havent unlocked for quests its really difficult sometimes.\n",
      "its honestly such a great game overall from game mechanics to character design and lore. but i wish they would add more end game content theres absolutely nothing to do once you clear every quest and 100 your exploration. overall great experience though.\n",
      "i like this game a lot is easy to play the storyline the graphics the characters are very cool. even without spending any money the game is fantastic. the only problem is getting 5 star artifacts and weapons and the fps drop when other people use a burst like the venti one even on ps4 \n",
      "such an exceptional game. they had a whole orchestra for music amazing scenery so much detail and effort. nice story and subevents. they are making it better in every update usually consider feedbacks but as it was stated by many others even if your mobile device is pretty good mine has 8 gb ram features are perfect for games it lags when it comes to stories. and there is huge damage gap like x6 between paid players and f2p due to constellations and 5 star characters. farming artifacts hard\n",
      "i played this game all time time on my computer but it died recently so i tried playing it on mobile and its way too hard with touch controls. a fight that would be no big deal is suddenly much harder and i die a lot. if they add at least controller support i play with keyboard and mouse usually but can adapt to controller id give this 5 stars as i really do enjoy this game. at the moment though its completely unplayable to me.\n",
      "hadnt the chance to play it i couldnt download it at once so i had to continue downloading it whenever i had internet after i got the update from play store i lost all the download progress and had to start over it was better if the graphic pack was optional or at least let the player download the graphics later on game.\n",
      "ive played this game since it first released and played continuously through each update. the game has the potential to be great but has one huge issue thats plagued it from the start the lack of skin tone diversity in genshin. the game takes inspiration from so many different cultures and fails to properly represent the people they are taking direct inspiration from. this has grown more apparent with the reveal of sumeru characters. they need to address this problem and be better.\n",
      "edited this review to reflect my current views of the game. game is fun characters are amazing the visual asthetic of the world is at times breathtaking. taking all of this in consideration it does lose some of its charm late game but not entirely. events are frequent and new characters get announced almost every patch.\n",
      "this is a great game. from the graphics and the map everything is perfect. 1 idea though i feel like its kind of ironic that the main character is 1 of the weakest characters in the game. i think it might be interesting if as they explore the nations they gain more elements they can control instead of just switching and becoming more powerful.\n",
      "this is one of the best games ive played so far though my only problem is that the damage numbers dont show up and its really annoying especially whenever i try to showcase my characters. i still have to change devices just to see numbers and its such a hassle because setting my devices up takes a long time. i dont really mind at most times although if you can please find a way to fix this bug \n",
      "i love this game lore characters graphics and gameplay are absolutely stunning theres a lot to do and explore and there are new updates very often there are obviously some meh things like artifacts farming or the pulling thing or the mobile graphics but they are not a big problem. its a free game and its super fun to play tho i recommend the pc version because its pretty hard to play on mobile.\n",
      "the game is amzing the art style got me hooked in from the beginning. the story is complex but also easy at the same time tne game could be better by making it online though but my rating is still a 5. it has so many characters and an emense storyline full of action any new players looking for an mmorpg this is the game to start with.\n",
      "a great game that makes me want to invest some time into it however makes it near impossible to do so due to the energy system resin . this makes especially less linear farming such as artifacts extremely lengthy with very little rewards if you get unlucky. overall id still recommend it however would also make clear that this isnt a game you can easily pick up and get everything quickly alone due to special 5 stars that appear like twice a year at best . youre okay with grind go for it.\n",
      "this game is absolutely awsome i have been playing it for two months now and i must say i became addicted i love the graphics and the quality and the voice actors but theres something that i would like to be changed leveling up your adventure rank is quite hard and slow that sometimes i lose hope and the artifacts thingy isnt quite explained during the game so i had to rely on other resources to understand so i would like an explanation from them plus for the leveling up to become easier.\n",
      "excellent optimization of suck a large game. great work also the game is amazing you cannot get bored easily because it constantly gets updated and every character has cons and pros. the only negative is the wish system because i have seen a lot of players spending a ton of money just to get some extra wishes to get their favorite character \n",
      "absolutely incredible game the only problem is the amount of space needed. ive had to delete almost all my apps for this game i am a huge fan of the game and adore playing it. but for mobile players like me it is horrible. the game runs very slowly as well so for all the data ive given up for it its a bit of a let down.\n",
      "the automatic climbing is so annoying. mid fight when i dash and if theres anything which can be climbed my character stops fighting and starts climbing. it just sticks to the wall and yea the camera omg in open areas mid fight i just see grass nothing else. it doesnt matter if i turn on or off the combat camera its just worst while fighting. edit ok they really did a good job on graphic optimisation. but the climbing part is still annoying and during battle i only see grass in open field.\n",
      "game is amazing main quests side quests with the scenery is beautiful ... aside from a few minor things such as lack of resin slightly annoying when you do large tasks for less primogems and the artifact farming can also be tiring but other than that this game is excellent.\n",
      "i love this game sm. especially the storyline. but there are fews bug glitch that always happen especially for players who using cheap device like me. anything that related with water in genshin for instance river and ocean. it always glowing which make me barely see anything. the last one is sometimes i cant see the opponent hp bar maybe theyre glitched. hope hoyoverses team can fix this.\n",
      "beautiful game both the lands and the characters are visually pleasing wish there were more darker skinned characters though. theres a lot of stuff you can buy but ive been playing for a few years and am proud to say i havent spent a dime even with that i still have so much fun playing and am not opposed to spending in the future.\n",
      "the good looks to have a great story with some nice characters. by all accounts the monetisation isnt too bad either. the bad the game is an unoptimised mess that took almost two hours from installation to actually being able to play assuming you can even play it out of five devices only two would install it and only one would then download the whole game. 14 gigabytes is just too big for a mobile game for most users. and the controls are awful too no autonav or autofight. play on pc.\n",
      "its a really good game the only problem is the game gets boring the more you play. there are less things to do. for something fun we have to wait for events. its also kinda hard to get primos ngl. another thing is sometimes i have to uninstall the game and reinstall the game re download everything just for one update \n",
      "been in the gacha game circle for years and was mainly here for that getting into it by one of my friends who plays more pvp than i do. i can say its been really fun so far for an open world mobile its so much fun to explore and see how the story unfolds for these past years making memories along the way. due to not only design and event problems though its rough to get the full story by not being pay to play. the grind is tedious if you want to flex but other than that its good.\n",
      "overall great game its just that for low end phone users we cant see grass dmg text and ice on water other problems such as loading too slowly while opening the game also loading too slowly on using waypoints entering domains teapot etc. some dialogue scenes glitch and not playing the whole thing the cutscenes are fine its just those problems hopefully u guys can fix thid long time issue\n",
      "i rate it a 4 otherwise i would rate it a five. i rated it a 4 because it can get your phone hit really quick within just 15 minutes of playing its a really fun game would totally recommend if your phone wont be destroyed by overheating. otherwise great game and would love to find more like these \n",
      "a fun game though after a while you eventually run out of content to play so the most you can do is do your daily commissions and grind to make your characters better which can get a bit repetitive but that is okay i also love the music and the sound design its really cool but regarding the character design hoyoverse dont be afraid to give the characters some melanin.. we have 2 tan characters and the rest is as white as snow im sure you can do better... right \n",
      "at first when downloading this game it does take a while maybe an hour or 2 but once it does its am easy sign up login then the quests are easy to follow its a fun battle story fantasy game that i believe everyone will enjoy there wasnt many bugs and when downloading make sure to have enough storage space its very very important 10 10 game \n",
      "i need help with my game for whatever reason my game keeps crashing at the loading elements after logging in and opening the door. the screan goes black and it closes the game off i then have to log in all over again and the same thing has happened. ive tried uninstalling and reseting my phone but nothings working please help \n",
      "the game has been on the decline and recently theyre stuffing events and character storyline with filler thats not fun only the main archon story quest is whats stopping me from quitting. its the fact they have characters keep waffling on and on about some random thing and have no action or using their combat system or puzzles not to mention each story takes multiple hours. ffs its a snoozefest. graphics are good yada yada but on god the storylines apart from main are boring af.\n",
      "this game is so great the only thing i can ask for is controller support for android and that would take the experience to a whole other level. please mihoyo update its been years and still no controller support. ios has had controller support for a long time now and we have been ignored it seems. i dont see why it hasnt happened yet.\n",
      "its hands down an awesome game. story. graphics. characters. all 5 stars. but recently there has been a lot of bugs lags and issues that i just cant play the game like i used to. fix the bugs id still be happy with lesser events if i could just play the game properly.\n",
      "fun game if you like exploration. for people like me who doesnt care about games lore and just want to explore and or go to action this game is a nightmare as we cant skip endless boring dialogs its such a headache honestly. at some point in the game you run out of stuff to do and theres nothing fun to do spiral abyss is a joke but the only joke we got left. its the opposite of usual mmorpg where you have a boring experience until u reach the endgame. the soundtrack is really good.\n",
      "i would say the game is really well done it has a lack of content for players who girnd the game daily and rush over the main missions however as a new player the game is really overwhelming. with new regions coming out and more and more characters avalible to play the game really feels more open and free. i do wish for changes in the gacha system but right now its okay . i really hope future updates will intruduce more quality of life changes.\n",
      "such a fun adventure game with a bunch of lore story and exploration all of the characters designs are beautiful. the only problems are probably that a lot of end game players dont have anything to do like quests and challenging stuff and the wish system and artifact domains are very rng.\n",
      "as a casual ive spent lots of free time into the game and i love it. the only gripe that i have with the game is that theres controller support for ios..... but not android. i use only android and now that i dont have my pc really makes it hard to play effectively although this is a personal thing . please mihoyo.... add controller support for the android \n",
      "i began playing a couple of days after launch. while i enjoy the lore and the characters there are a myriad of technical improvements that should be made. i dont think controller support should be something exclusive to iphone users. i think hoyoverse at the very least owes its android users an answer. i would probably play far more if i could use a controller.\n",
      "overall this game is amazing. cant believe that this game is for free the graphics charcters fighting style and the world in genshin impact would rate them 1000 10. the best game i have ever played best experience and best in game music i have ever heard. the music is so relaxing and enjoyable. really love the graphics charcter designs and how every character is different from the other. would highly highly recommend to play this game for everyone especially anime watchers. 10 10\n",
      "i love this game and i would rate it a 5 star but ive had a problem with a few things. the archon quest in which we fight tartaglia heart of glaze when i reached the last part ive had my screen turn dim and i couldnt touch anything and i still cannot complete the quest this is very annoying and since i cant complete thta quest i cant even unlock the domain. edit now its fixed and im eating it five stars but hoyoverse where is yaoyao its been 2years keep up the good work hoyoverse\n",
      "this game got me hooked. sad to say though i no longer have it on my phone because 64gb phone isnt enough for this. but still i cant get over and im giving them a 5 star review. i love the characters their gameplay their stories the design overall aesthetics and most of all the good music. if youre ok doing commissions and farming stuff to build your team well even if most are rng i highly recommend this. also thank you for being the only game with albedo diluc and venti.\n",
      "be ready to get addicted to an open world adventure game. full of multiple quest along with an interesting story line. you will get lost in all the different things you can do and develop your character. definitely a very fun game to play. you can play on your computer also just link an email account and you can play on the go or at home \n",
      "when i first heard of this game i thought it was interesting but at the same time think its like other games. but i had no other choices since i would like to battle. but after playing this game i love it. the characters enemies regions everything is amazing. even though it is hard to get the character you wanted it is still fun. you can even play with your friends. though your storage may not handle it i still think its fun.\n",
      "i love the characters storyline lore music in the game im really looking forward to more of sumeru in the 3.1 update as well. i also have a suggestion for the 2nd anniversary maybe one free 5 character 30 wishes for event exclusive characters event wish banner and new pair of wings because i like the ones from last year please do so that other apps that arent associated with hoyoverse dont get review bombed because of another anniversary prob like last year. like googleclassroom\n",
      "its the perfect game that i was looking for. i wanted to try something new something different and it is my first rpg game. it has massive and gorgeous map with awesome characters and well written storyline. overall i wanted a game that i could play for long time and not just play it for a week and then uninstall it. it gives pc like experience on phone. however the gacha aspect and its fandom ugh..\n",
      "one of the most inspiring rpg ever created. the right amount of adventure lore battle system and importance of characters personalities all tied in a beautifully crafted game. recommended to first time rpg players as well since guides are easy to follow and subtle hints are found within the game. enjoy exploring teyvat traveler \n",
      "its a great game and it was worth the get but it took me 17 hours for it to load and it kinda takes a while to load my lvl and stuff tho it is a awesome game and am thinking of giving it a five star like i said before took me 17 20 hours to load. theres 24 hours in a day anyway besides that its not bad i love it still but could you fix a few stuff.of and theres a whole lot of bugs i found in there being not able to pick up stuff having to leave the game and go back in that stuff gotta fix\n",
      "i been playing the game for almost 2 years now when the first time i played the game on the release day and i enter the world i didnt notice the damage grass frozen water dvalin and la signora. now dvalin and la signora is fix when 2.7 update come out and its really help new player but i still cant see the damage grass frozen water pls help why is it not fix yet.\n",
      "the game is overall great the graphics are amazing the designs are stunning and the story is very intriguing. although hoyoverse really need to learn to be more generous with the in game rewards such as story quest rewards and particular world quests. also inazuman chests are trash because you need to defeat 4 or 5 samurai just to get to open a simple common chest which you can randomly find in monstadt and liyue. please work on that \n",
      "love this game but just lately it keeps crashing on my phone and making it utterly unplayable. i cant even get passed the white loading screen before it crashes and closes. find i have to clear cache and reset phone each time it does this to solve the issue and have the settings in game all down to the lowest settings\n",
      "the game is fun but once you get so far in the game and need upgrade materials your are doing a lot of waiting either 3 days a week and some material you only get a chance once a week and a lot of characters need that for certain attack upgrades. that makes me start loosing my interest in playing.\n",
      "awesome game potential horrible implementation the character designs world building puzzles lore and everything around these lines is so great but the gameplay us awful. open world gets stale really fast oculi are a chore that needs hours to be completed using resin and doing comissions takes too much time. added difficulty everywhere using time limit instead of making the enemies actually challenging. plus the free rewards and rates as a gacha are terrible.\n",
      "that is what i expect from a game the graphics gameplay characters are all a sight for sore eyes. i dont have a complaint with the game but i guess they should add controller in android as well its available in ios but i dont have one and it would feel great to be able to play with controller on android\n",
      "genshin impact is really a great game. i have had my fair share of fun times playing it. the story is top notch. gameplay is good and smooth. ingame rewards are underwhelming. progression is horrible. always money hungry. hard to upgrade without paying i dont want to pay for upgrades after buying a character. i became a regular spender but dont feel like continuing after realizing how horrible this system is. will play for story cutscenes only. i hope they fix these things.\n",
      "this is a fun game with great graphics and even better lore and characters but my only annoyance is with the gacha system. its much different than other games gacha systems and in a bad way. to even get one 5 star character you want you have to actually spend money which is very annoying. and even then you might not even get the 5 star you want. f2p beware \n",
      "great game although its a bit hard sometimes lag and could fix the awkward view angle since every battle it keeps on auto adjusting to weird angles and make the battles harder since it needs to be adjusted again. but overall its a very good game 5 stars \n",
      "everything would be fine if there wouldnt be android users biscrimination. controllers buttons in game are far too inconvenient so external gamepad is the way to go but there is no external controller support for android. please provide a support for android users as it was done to ios users as fast as it is possible.\n",
      "i like the game overall but theres just one problem that i really want you guys to solve.actually theres a bug while im fighting the storm terror randomly theres this thingy appeared and the shapes is mostly triangles that looks like storm terror and its blocking my sight and it became pixelated...but yeah i love the game but please fix the bug.\n",
      "well the wouldve been fun if it wasnt for the one of the worst mechanics ever in video game if you throw an enemy off a cliff or if they accidentally fall down or you get out of their reach for a couple of seconds or at times when you manage to outrun the enemies for a while thr game simply respawn the emeny with full health and some of them take like 1000 hits to go down and can literally one shot you and the game simply reset the enemy when theyre about to kill them after 10 mins of combat\n",
      "the best game i dont recommend. very grindy expects a lot of your time for little payout even if you spend money. just read the wiki and manga instead. the world is beautiful the story general gameplay are okay but it takes about a month to build one character and the entire game is designed around making you spend as much of your time as possible on it without giving you much for your effort. spending money helps you get characters but it doesnt get you better items or equipment.\n",
      "this game is nice but it needs more accessibility options to reduce flashing screens camera movements etc. contrast sliders and colourblind modes would be nice. also for some reason my app weighs over 30 gigabytes while others have it at around 18gb.\n",
      "great game just a little too much work when you need to find some things in the events. not giving enough primogems either for free to play players. when wishing you get too many of the same character a feature should be added where as after u unlock all constallations you no longer get the character when wishing.\n",
      "i do love the game but however the lag has become so unbearable recently on my device. its kinda sad even walking my lag is horrible not to mention its on the lowest graphics and quality too. tried contacting but no response one bit. the games good but it becomes unplayable due to the heavy lag and it even got to the point the lag kicked me out of the game edit even after i finally got a response from the email im still experiencing this problem did everything and nothing uninstalling.\n",
      "this game is good. i like the plot i think the gameplay is different than any other game that i have played and good graphic. the graphics is my favourite. however the game is heavy. i usually play this game from 2 to 3 hours everytime i play and my phone will become so hot at the end. it is addictive though hehe\n",
      "to be honest i love this game. its special to me. the graphics are beautiful the music as well and i love many of the characters. playing for both the story and the fighting is super fun. however because this game is beautiful and special to me in so many ways i continue to be very disappointed in the company for lack of representation in the game. with the upcoming updates still nothing is being done about this despite major complaints from the poc communities. do better hoyoverse. pls.\n",
      "i really love this game because its open world. free to go everywhere you like as long you follow the main story to unlock the map. and what the best thing i like in this game is player cant distrub you world like take the treasure kill the boss without permission. and the bad thing i dont like in this game is no mount..just can walk run using stamina climb fly and using teleport. the map not small really huge map. mine still beginners lol.. and why no daily reward in game.. \n",
      "personally i love the game it has cool characters nice game play beautiful graffics. tho i miss how i played kn the beginning the quests and stuff when youre ar 45 everything is just a repeat do your dailies and spend your resin. ofc you still have side quests you can do but theyre boring. all that said im looking forward to sumuru and ill see how that is \n",
      "this game is absolutely amazing. this game can be a little addicting but overall its a pretty fun game. one thing there is not much for the endgame players. the game is great for the new and upcoming players. the storyline the animations the characters are all perfect. this game is not pay to win. you can be a free to play and still thrive in this game. if u put ur time and effort into it. this game is still going on in terms of storyline. so thats pretty exciting to look out for.\n",
      "this game is cool and all but for a beginner its kinda difficult to get used to and its hard to get characters. i have also failed a few too many times at the flying gliding test thing t t. alr so i loaded it up after around a month of not playing it took an hour to load update then i got onto the game and all my progress was gone. i was back at the start. what happened \n",
      "i love the game to the point that i even bought a new phone to have a better experience hahaha. tho i have heard a lot of complaints about the first anniversary rewards is kind of cheap. this is my first anniv. with genshin so i hope it will be memorable. furthermore the lore the gameplay the characters and all are amazing \n",
      "by far the best f2p game ive played in years. i joined at launch and played non stop for over a year. however this game can be grindy and can burn you out. i havent missed any events but havent felt the need to 100 everything anymore as some things can become quite boring or repetitive. cant wait for sumeru \n",
      "absolutely love the in game atmosphere and music the lore is very interesting too. the pacing of events are just fine for me because i play it casually. graphics are superb especially the character animations that look fluid and smooth.\n",
      "love the new update but now i cant even play without the app crashing. not even five seconds into entering the game it immediately crashes. now the game is quite literally unplayable for me. ive tried deleting apps and useless files but it was still fruitless. hope hoyoverse could do something about this.\n",
      "the game is too op but the problem is its censor system in chats its just trash it even censors the things that are not meant to and i would suggest a system where you can like send a gift to a friend like primos or some ascension items or artifacts... and a skip dialogue cutscenes option would be great too.. over all the lore and character storyis great also pls introduce new hot male characters...\n",
      "good but its a bit slow and has a bit too much grinding needs alot of attention if i could change it somehow it would definitely be adding a dodge function controller support and letting me do more things for exp and primos like let me do everything more than just once a day that way i can just spend like 2 hours one day grinding instead of wasting more than 3 days on it getting frustrated and sometimes just not having the time and being unable to do the story quest at all due to account rank\n",
      "really good game graphics story everything is great . the only thing that bothers me is that if you want to change your server u have to start from the beginning. idk if its possible to transfer your data into the new server but if it is.. could you do that many people want that too. \n",
      "fantastic overall. the music is phenomenal and the art style is gorgeous. i have played this game since launch and honestly there is no gacha game that comes close when it comes to the amount of fun that can be had in this game. i have met many friends along the way as well. there are many improvements needed for this game though. like for example at least one end game permanent continous event. the rewards could even be small. keep teasing next patch characters that has been great too. thanks\n",
      "i love the story of the game. i love lisa in there sole reason im playing is because of her. but one negative point i am struggling like of some people to make this game work on an android 13 when it can work. whether i set the graphics high low it doesnt work and the game lags. anyway i love the game. thanks for the masterpiece.\n",
      "i rally like this gane but i cant even olay because the game is constantly lagging and reconnecting to severs this is incredibly annoying. and really not worth all the things i deleted and space it took up on my phone. im so close to uninstalling this gane because its is so annoying not being able to play without crashes.\n",
      "even though it takes much time to get primogems i honestly love the game and it still so enjoyable. i sadly want to rate it 4 star cause it takes too much storage. i wish i could delete some quests that i have done and without a fan the game lags too much.\n",
      "ive grown addicted to the game and i absolutely love the characters but one of my main problems with the games is the artifact farming i have to spend at most 5 condensed resin a day only to have everything go to defense or hp. i hope you guys improve the chances of getting good artifacts or increase the resin limit so that we dont have to constantly waste our resin.\n",
      "this has been my favourite game since the release the storyline and lore is very interesting. the only problem is that once all the story quests hangouts events abyss and exploration are all done and you have no resin it gets quite boring and repetitive. good game tho d also please let us pet the animals i am begging\n",
      "the game is fine overall there are nice characters and the world is very complex though there are some issues. it is too time consuming trying to get good artifacts new characters and generally doing long quests or puzzles. also the variety in the characters skin tones is concerning. theres absolutely no representation of dark skinned people even the ones supposed to be dark skinned are pale and that should be talked about more.\n",
      "although the game is far from perfect like the resin and artifact systems and amount of daily commitment its still one of my favorites for a few reasons despite being a gacha game every character can be built to perform well. captivating world design and extensive soundtrack. lots of in game lore in story quests readable books weapon and character and artifact descriptions and npc dialogue elaborate combat system and party system assigning an element and unique set of skills.\n",
      "the game is amazing but it has grossed over 4 billion dollars...its about time we get several new enemy types please this would really make the game much more interesting to play through or at least gives us something new to be excited about seeing and fighting.\n",
      "i love this game so much. i honestly havent played any kind of game in years and i decided to download genshin impact because of the ads i kept seeing on instagram. everything about it from the music to the scenery is spectacular. playing genshin particularly focusing on the story love has helped with my anxiety attacks so much. it reminds me so much of zelda which i played when i was younger. the open world flexibility is the absolute best. thank you so for this beautiful game \n",
      "its not new player friendly. im a long time player since 1.0 and noticed how events are region main story character story locked. the events are not available for new players. even for players that have been in hiatus and trying to come back its unforgiving. most of the time it causes them to just dropped the game completely. theres a high chance you wont understand a lot of things because important lores are event exclusive hidden or plain translated weirdly.\n",
      "seems pretty cool. i didnt get that far after getting amber as a character before it lagged and blacked out my screen. speaker was going crazy too trying to play the music. only reason i was able to exit was because my wife called me. hope it gets fixed but for me its an uninstall\n",
      "cool. some performance issues here and there but it plays well. wish there was a settings menu in game to adjust controls as well the movement stick being in a set location doesnt feel good.\n",
      "the game has been very upsetting the past few weeks. because every time that i try to load up the game it gets past the first loading screen but when i open the door to enter the game it crashes. ive tried everthing i can think of to fix this problem and to no avail every time i boot up the game i analyze the files and it always says that some are missing. i let the files update and despite saying the files are fine it still kicks me from the game and says some are missing when i boot back up.\n",
      "an absolutly wonderful game 100 would recommend. although if you are playing on mobile beware of glitches other then that this game has an amazing story plot and wonderful graphics music and sceanery. the characters are amazing too.\n",
      "tbh the game kinda sucks on mobile but that is because the medium doesnt give the game justice. do yourself a favor and play it on pc. i love almost everything about the game. the english va is awesome the visuals are astounding the osts are mesmerising there is lore everywhere the stories are touching epic funny and well written almost all the characters are interesting in their way and all have their personality. the gameplay theorycraft and optimization are deeper than it appears.\n",
      "i have been seeing a couple of problems in genshin as a mobile player. even though my phone can handle the game pretty well being a 6gb ram phone theres still some issues i face firstly the lack of servers meaning if you dont live near a certain server your ping would always be atleast 100 and thats really not helping at all. the second thing i cant see ice grass and damage text maybe its my phone but id like your answer. i support you guys and your work please fix these issues\n",
      "so recently i changed my phone into a 8 3 ram and i played this game since i expect that 8 3 ram is enough performance to play the game with no lag problem. after downloading the files and play it somehow the graphics are terrible the fps is very low when i completed the tutorial i checked the graphics setting and if i apply 60 fps it says that its too much when. when i try it its very laggy eventho i make it medium but the fps is 60 still\n",
      "the game is pretty addictive. the main problem is that being an f2p will be hard as it will take a long time for you to get charecters and eventually level them up. but the game makes sure that you do not face problem on being an f2p giving us options to decrease difficulty and also time enough to develop our charecters. the graphics sound and story is awesome. i am an f2p myself but i love this game.\n",
      "its always lags on mobile and can stop completely. but other than the fact that the low key white wash the characters its a good game and fun to play alone and with others. i hope that in the future they make more inclusive characters with darker skins.\n",
      "love love love this game the characters the lore the scenery are everything however new content takes too much time to be released and sometimes new content puzzles such as in 2.8 gaa are too difficult to solve that i gave up and stopped playing for several days \n",
      "pretty incredible game given the huge content which is completely free. huge zelda botw like world to explore. gacha is not great but you can do absolutely everything even with free characters with the exception of the abyss dungeons which require more investment which is the only real endgame content of the game currently. i strongly discourage people playing this on mobile though. open world exploration and combat is far more suited for pc or console.\n",
      "its a fun game to play but when you get to adventure rank 50 and above theres a lack of things to do unless there are events. ive completed every quest in the game exept for one or two that are locked behind commisions and have gotten everywhere 100 exploration exept sumeru which came out on the day im writing this. so overall fun to play but has a lack of things to do at a higher adventure rank.\n",
      "this game is fun and adventure you can upgrade your character weapon and other thing that you can upgrade things i like it. but here a problem it just too much storage and i cant download other app. why cant you company try fix less storage. for example 10gb 9gb or less storage. so please fix the less storages so i can download other app.\n",
      "hmm it has a time problem. it is unsatisfactory how you can stay stuck. being unable to see any real content for such a long few days. but its addictingly good... free to play... its consequential. for sure really dont get stuck trying to play the game free to play. it will be good but like the ying to yang it will take your time. but at least you may enjoy it. i guess. shrug idk depending on who you are.\n",
      "designs are beautiful music is chefs kiss characters have such great personality and lovable. its very hard to not get attached to this game for its lore and story is top tier. the games adds a new twist on open world games and draws inspirations from other games while not being too copied . amazing how its a free game of course there is the option of paying money for in game currency however these currencies are given by simply putting in effort to grind in the game.\n",
      "love this game... however... the game develops know what issues need to be fixed. the same issues that have been in the game before inazuma was even a concept on top of new issues regarding character models . the game is good at telling a story and theres nothing wrong with that however i play this because its a game. it hurts when those main elements of a game are lacking and itll only get worse from here. i just really hope cognosphere fixes many or all of these issues in 3.0 sumeru .\n",
      "this game is just awesome. it is worth of getting 4 stars but it needs 8 to 16 gb ram for high and medium quality graphics. my phone is 4gb ram and i cannot afford 8 or 16 gb ram mobile. so i wish to the developers please make a settings where 4gb ram players also can play with 60 fps and high quality graphics. \n",
      "an amazing game with amazing graphics and combat aswell with great enemies and amazing lore. only reason i gave 4 stars is because its just to pay to win like most gotcha games but the rewards given to the community are less and less when you start getting into the higher ars please hoyoverse give us some more serotonin and stop making us run off copium. changed it to 4 stars because three does not seem right \n",
      "i think that the combat is to easy there should be an option to activate hardcore combat that is a bit like sekirot an stand endurance that can be broken which stuns you by being attacked or blocking at the false time. realystic damage for you and the enemy like being dead after 5 hits but same for the enemy of curse big enemies and bosses tank more like 15 35 for big and 50 150 for bosses way weaker regeneration and so on. so that pro player get a real challenge for way better lot.\n",
      "words cannot explain how amazing this game is. really makes one feel guilty about not paying for this game. the gacha system is not at all mandatory and quests are generous. the gameplay and graphics are spectacular. the story being marvelous beautiful soundtracks surreal world design huge open world all make this game the best one in the mobile platform.\n",
      "this is not a mobile phone friendly game it lags a lot even if im at my ultra lowest settings the storage capacity is so large that you need a seperate dedicated phone with only this game installed to be able to play it semi smoothly. updates are so large that some mobile users are forced to replace phones that have larger ram and storage just to keep up.. if youre a mobile player only like me i recommend to use an ultra high end phone just to keep up at least until their natlan release.\n",
      "even though iam too old for playing these kind of games. but i still loved this game. it relaxes my mind when i play it the natural view gameplay character design background music story all are great. my overall experience was great so far. but iam afraid reaching higher ar soon makes you feel bored.\n",
      "random crashes are occouring in game. edit. be wary of this game progression you have to dump money even in stamina resin if you wanna progress at anything but a snails pace. im taking about taking more than month to build a character to level 80. also cant play for more than 20 minutes without hitting resin wall. and this makes abyss which gives a pitiable amount of primogems impossible.\n",
      "i think the game is a good game to play especially if you love gacha games and anime games like me . the one thing is genshin takes time and you have to grind stuff every day which is pretty fun but it gets boring after a while for me at least when doing that over and over. i do like the fact that you can hang out with your friends in a world and do domains with eachother. i feel like new updates always get the hype for genshin impact back for me.\n",
      "amazing love the grafics the characters in the game are stinning the lore is also very nice really recommend if you like the type of adventure game what i love the most is that its a open world explore you can join with friends or if your like me a very lonely person you can make new friends while your at it join worlds get new characters for your team you can also fight bosses and other villains.\n",
      "have been playing non stop for 3 days my life is ruined and i dont mind. i love open world games so this one is just like heaven. the characters are beautiful the story so far is not bad graphics are nice. the amount of storage this game takes which is 15gb is too much given that it requires internet connection to run and i dont like the gacha mechanic because i dont have billions of money to spend on fictional characters but sure its a nice game. upd the story is cringy but ok\n",
      "its a good game im not going to say its the best game ever made because im still a rookie here are a few things to know. the download is quick but you will have to register and the wait after will test you patience but once its done collecting data the game is beautiful there are some parts you may have to legit search up on youtube bc theyre hard to do. the last is when youre swimming you only get so much time before they drown \n",
      "i start by stating my bias towards an opposed experience against my personal gameplay experience. it is a game for sure with many of the addictive qualities people have come to enjoy in this genre. however my key issues with the game as of late involve the player progression experience not being addressed the excessive random elements in the game and of course their questionable character design decisions. i could write a literary essay about my concers but these are the primary of them.\n",
      "this is a 5 star game for me and one of my favorite games period. with a beautiful world to explore a fascinating story and so many very well written characters to meet its been such a fun year of playing. it can get a little grind y and there isnt a ton of endgame content yet. aside from that its honestly a great experience if you dont mind investing a little time. well more than a little. super recommend \n",
      "amazing game its a great game for people who like the more adventure kind of aspect in games as well as fight aspects. its got amazing graphics too the only thing id like to see personally is a more diverse range of characters\n",
      "more diversity. i have been playing this game for almost 2 years and i love it with my whole heart but the main issue i have with it is that there isnt much skin diversity. i really thought this game would be more inclusive since its really popular and adds variety of cultures. but when it comes to skin tone we only see tons of white skin and only two characters that are slightly tanned and are not that dark. i was hopeful that you would add more characters with darker skin tone but nope.\n",
      "look i love the game and it runs great on my pocofone but the game is just way too big at this point. like dude i dont have any room anymore. maybe if there was an in game option cause a lot of phones dont allow this without root to allocate all the data onto an sd card then it would be amazing. 20 gigs is just ridiculous imo. please make data and obb location to sd card a thing. you dont allow this game on shadow pc and i cant play this game anymore because of these two issues\n",
      "theres not much to complain about with genshin. ive been playing for almost a year now and continue to be impressed on a regular basis. people mention lack of endgame content but i prefer quality over quantity and the quality of this game is superior to most games ive played the visuals lore music and overall attention to detail are all amazing. very well thought out and consistently excellent. im definitely a fan and not embarrassed to admit it. keep up the good work \n",
      "this game sets the bar in mobile gaming. a huge open world game that you can play anywhere. this also proves that players prefer games that dont have an auto mode. it feels more rewarding to see your characters grow from the result of your hard work and grinding. the story is interesting. characters design are unique. the graphics look amazing. gameplay voice acting soundtrack are all great. features like climbing gliding also adds quality as well. u just lacking on the anniv rewards\n",
      "in my opinion 100 best game i have ever played. the game gives us amazing game play tutorials the art style of the game is fantastic i love the character personalities and just the story lines are amazing. even thou working to get stuff and feeling multiple pains after struggling to get a character you want or just in fighting things the game makes it up to u. the stories reach my heart. honesty speaking all i want to say is i love this game with all my heart and i recommend that you play it \n",
      "it finally and i was very happy but sadly its opening cut scene onwards its lagging heavily. im using a redmi pro 7s plz send a patch to fix this soon the game looks gorgeous and i really want to get into it n recommend it to my friends for co op. old review still stands but has had major improvements still need just the fps fix to be consistent. at 24 still laggy even with 10 to 15 mbps but has moments of fluidity even at 60fps hence 3 stars nw.\n",
      "it really is fun to play but its always lagging and you probably wont be able watch many cut scenes normally. edit they fixed all the problems and its awesome \n",
      "game is best. but for new player its close to never... you cant catch up.... youll be behind... and every damn thing need quest to complete so you can experience something new.... questing is borring as hell..... please provide skip option.\n",
      "love this game sm been playing for 460 days and its so fun . i think they should add more resin at least 180 instead of 160 considering that there are more bosses and domains added . other than that the game is the best thing ive ever played some people in co op are a holes but there are amazing people in co op too . its fun and adventurous its even more fun playing with friends or meeting random people \n",
      "its a very great game . always have up dates and keep bring in good content. but i wish i was had half the luck of my friend. he gets all the new characters with easy. i spend almost 100. but im probably not going to get the newest 5 star unfortunately but did get another mona. but the problem is i get so annoyed by my friend. when i should just truly enjoy the game and the characters i have already. so i try not to be as salty anymore and more thankful.\n",
      "very incredible game if youre into an adventure game. but you need money or the devils luck to get the characters you want. the game can fully be played for free. but its hard to fully enjoy it without its characters. but its a gacha \n",
      "its a really good game but i hate the fakt that they dont tell u what to do at all. the first time i played it it was ok but after some time you dont know where to go what to do or how to continue the storyline. and i hate the fakt that you have to be on a specific level to play online with friends or people. and yeah....that would be all for now.... bye and enjoy the game 3\n",
      "its been a while since i started the game and i completely love it yet i find the gacha quite difficult because the percentage of having a 5 is quite low as a personal view. but i completely love the game the lore the graphics the music etc. everything is amazing in this game \n",
      "very good gameplay really pretty graphics nice character designs and its just great tbh. it just gets boring the more you play and the more you progress the only thing keeping you in the game is attachment to a certain character or your friends there. ps vv laggy if you use other big storage games.\n",
      "phenomenal. if you truly want the experience a game that you develop with play puzzles love fictional characters craziest lore and seeing hidden details as you go well this is the game a true masterpiece. i have never seen grass ever since.\n",
      "this is definitely the greatest game of all time. why the gameplay the world building the voice characters music everything works together so well that it maximize the gameplay experience. try it out its so worth it.\n",
      "got burnt out so just 4 stars. new events feel like chores and doesnt add like spicy lore or fun story times exceptions for some dialogues and overall once a new region or area goes live theres nothing much new to add to the gameplay. like in the chasm there are a resonating puzzle thingy which i liked but theres only a few of them. i dont know how you can add more spicyness to the game but yeah thats whats missing. like the boom shakalaka factor ya know sumeru seems promising tho.\n",
      "i cant believe i slept on this for so long. it is so good the story is incredible the localization is seriously on point and the world... the world is gorgeous. this game is the reason im buying a gamepad for my phone. ive been stuck in bed recovering from surgery playing this like all day for a week and still i feel like ive seen maybe 10 of everything there is to see. and i cant believe not only is a ton of it voice acted but the acting is amazing i get why this is so popular \n",
      "mobile version of genshin impact sucks. you can not customize the buttons. you have to handle jump sprint burst skill all with one finger. not to mention the same finger is needed for moving camera.. literally impossible to play fast.\n",
      "its a well fleshed out story with fleshed out characters the views are absolutely beautiful and the animations are almost flawless and its not that laggy even for it being a open world with great graphics so i do suggest people play \n",
      "after 8 months thank god im seeing some improvements in compatibility issues i got less fps drop now but im still hoping to get a better graphics optimization and in regards with wishing system i still think its not friendly and still exorbitant.\n",
      "well its an amazing game i really loved it and the challenges a hoot just to say that some of the quests i do wont let me give the npcs the things it needs like the quest talk to the chief of konda village. please try to fix that but overall good game \n",
      "guys i need help. i want to danload the sumeru update but its not danloading. i have enough space in my tablet to danload it so i dont know what the problem is. also ive been trying for hours but its not working it keeps telling me waiting for wifi even though my wifi is just fine. if you know how to solve the problem in any way please respond to this. thanks.\n",
      "i love this game. the events especially windtrace and windblume festival characters places puzzles archon quests story quests world quests open world mechanism weekly bosses world bosses enemies and everything in this game is very beautiful and well designed. looking forward for new places snezhnaya for example new events new characters new bosses new quests and more things.\n",
      "unlike other games where the the cliche plot just goes on this game has his own unique plot with unique character designs and back stories that connect with all the main stories in a perfect way gacha system is great though its kind of frustrating but excitement is the point. i love this game.\n",
      "nearly 2 years of playing and still the best mobile game ive played. with amazing graphics and smooth gameplay well only if you have a good device gorgeous landscapes lore actually worth reading on and paired alongside absolutely phenomenal music the gameplay experience is unparalleled. the combat system is fun as well. however it still has its flaws like its character designs especially for sumerus characters and skimpy rewards. overall still a great game worth giving a try.\n",
      "overall this game is really fun to use the storyline characters plot etc. is very good...my phone is vivo y20i and its very good at gaming from codm to crk and pjsekai ml their game works very fine with phone and it runs very smoothly but when im at genshin it always kicks me i tried timing it and it took me about 9minites before i got kicked out again i also noticed that my graphics arent working i noticed lately that i didnt have grass ice and i cant see my dmg still giving a 4 tho\n",
      "pls fix the entire game every now and then for some reason the game doesnt start and it leaves me on white screen and when that happens i end up redownloading everything which is extremely annoying and time consuming if u cant fix the resin artifact and rng system then atleast fix the starting screen\n",
      "i love the graphics very realistic. battling with enemies and completing quests is very fun. though i have a recommendation for the game makers come up with a way to trade characters that one doesnt like want for level up materials\n",
      "genshin impact is a fantastic game. it has its issues with lack of endgame being chief among them but the game is my favorite that ive ever played. that includes 30 to 60 dollar aaa games and even the witcher 3. even if you never spend a dollar on it you will have a great time. highly recommend.\n",
      "this game is really fun to play with but im having some problems every time i use a burst using my 5 star character my opponents hp always disappear and i cant play some quest cause it wont start its just black screen and sounds but ive already start the quest for almost 30 minutes it still wont start how can will i be able finish the quest if it wont start please fix it \n",
      "im just gonna get straight to the point. i freaking love this game. the playstyle models and even the lore is just chefs kiss. but i do have one problem. diversity. if you are going to have an area based on a middle eastern country then why are the characters so pale it doesnt hurt anyone to put in a little melanin on some characters. but other than that great game 10 10.\n",
      "so far im loving the game the storyline and graphics are great as well as the monsters and characters. edit i still love the game but ihave a few problems the level cap is too low it gets really boring the moment you 100 the exploration and the resin cap is too low these are my problems atm. theres nothing for you to do once you basically reach ar 60 and 100 all locations except for the daily commissions all you gotta really depend now is the events i do hope chests respawn\n",
      "the game is great if you enjoy exploring gorgeous areas and story content. even if the managers of the game need to become better at their jobs they do loyally deliver content every couple weeks which is quite admirable.\n",
      "amazing open world game. though you should pace yourself because there is not much to do at high adventure ranks aside from making characters stronger talents etc etc. needs to be more storage friendly.\n",
      "great game but its not mobile friendly especially for those who uses low mid end mobile phones and it takes a lot of storages please add more graphics option like rendering distance etc. so that they can play with smoother experience\n",
      "its so fun to support the game for a year and then being f up by the anniversary rewards being extremely bad. im disappointed and disgusted at how badly they treat their fanbase. the game has great aesthetics great story great characters... but the fact that they treat us like this makes me disappointed.\n",
      "i am playing this game since it was released the game size is large but i face no problem playing this in low end phone 4 gb ram 64gb rom ofcourse i cant play it in best graphics but in low graphics as well i enjoy game it is a premium game no other game ive played like this it is totally free to play no ads no bugs no gliches story is amazing \n",
      "ive been playing since launch and spent a consequent amount of money in the game. a few weeks ago my account has been hacked and sold and hoyoverse wont give it back to me even though i have solid proof that the account is mine purchase receipts precise information about the account... . i filled the form to retrieve a stolen account provided all the necessary information the proof and my application got rejected. i am extremely disappointed in the customer service.\n",
      "please optimize the game for both new processors and old processors 3 or 4 years ago players need fluidity in the game no matter if the device is old or new. and also add more ressin to the game i mean the ressin ends the play ends too. and also the way to get artifacts is annoyance. remove the stats by number and just keep the percentages.\n",
      "graphics for high end device is so cool the lighting from the lamps are beautiful the stories are great and awesome and the characters designs are so wonderful and the movement is great. keep improving this game\n",
      "i love this game and mihoyo. im so hype when 1.2 was started especially the f2p event consideration. minus 2 stars because before 1.1 medium graphics set up with 30fps is so smooth af with nova 5t 980kirin processor but after 1.2 so disappointing it keeps fps drop and even i change it to low graphic setup its still laggy. please notice on this and make an optimization patch.\n",
      "the game is phenomenal i really like the graphics and the character design. not pnly that but the stories that you tell give me great appreciation to the writers of the game. not only that but also the customer service are so helplful. thank you for this game hoyoverse may you continue to make this game more great than it is.\n",
      "this game is pretty much the one other get compared to and sets the standards. great story visuals playstyle music and battles. only downside is slow recharge and amount of resin for collecting rewards.\n",
      "it is a nice game ive been playing for a year but in the latest update everytime i go in sumeru the game crashes. my friends also experiencing this problem. i hope you can fix it soon because i cant do the new events.\n",
      "literally unplayable on mobile. the particle effects lag my device so hard that it takes me an hour to do the amount of gameplay that i usually get done in 10 minutes on console. even the menus frequently fail due to probable memory leaks.\n",
      "the game has a large world which is fun to explore and new areas are added almost every update. new characters tend to be underwhelming but may receive indirect buffs over time. their simplistic kit remains boring though. there are a lot of clunckyness and qol issues that have existed since release. this makes combat an unoptimal experience. the endgame is lackluster. it consists of a small daily loop that uses fomo to keep you playing. new sumeru update is good and has the best story yet.\n",
      "even if you didnt gave me yoimiya this is still the best game ever. the music the animation and literally every part of the game is beautiful except when you lose 50 50 cant wait for sumeru t t im so excited cause its so beautiful and its the place that ive been dreaming about since i was a kid and always wanted to go to. thank you for fulfilling that dream \n",
      "the game is great when you can actually play it. it either crashes before i can start playing or on mobile devices it always says insufficient storage no matter how much space i make for it and how many times i reset it.\n",
      "after meeting some friends and doing some reading my experience has really improved. the story is okay. a lot of detail goes into each characters lore which i personally like. aside from paimon the english voice acting is really well done and there are recognizable names. it loses a star due to how money hungry the game is but its to be expected. if you can sort your in game priorities its not too hard to save. but youll unfortunately be passing by a lot of opportunities.\n",
      "amazing graphics story and fun characters to play though it is hard to play the game if you dont put money into it and i dont reccoment interacting with other players off the game but other than that its a great game \n",
      "one of the best open world rpg game out there for mobiles i bet you wont get disappointed for playing this as it comes with good story to boot with awesome graphics and music as well with anime style graphics design. well some ppls might not like the anime style design but most does and i do love it too.\n",
      "my phone is over heating. also there are many bugs and lags in new map sumeru and other maps also. i got to say that when chatting with someone my keypad gets down without my permission ... plz look after these things for us moblie users too. because we dont have keyboard. but still at the end i would still give u a full star from me. thanks for this game. also plz look after this game in making more interesting because i have completed all main quests... i want more.\n",
      "the game is good.. but only if you havent ambition because the rng system is super ridiculous and the devs dont want to change anything. i stuck with some artifacts for months though i have some good 4 pieces i cant ascent them into 5 because theres no such function. my time is going to nowhere everyday every week and even every month since i got only trash artifacts with the same repetitive domain. boring. the most successful cross platform game is just a bait to sell you pixels for nr.\n",
      "this is the best game i have experienced for a long time the extensive world is really beautiful and the story line is captivating and entertaining. although there are in app purchases it is still fairly easy to get powerful characters and do good damage without spending money.\n",
      "i really like the game but i always crash in cutscene. right now im a ar lvl 35 stuck because of the always lagging cutscene. its not my device dont doubt the newst phone s22 galaxy ultra not working on this game. and i have reinstall it 3 times. might as well delete this game sooner or later.\n",
      "awesome ive played many f2p over the years i was introduced by my son who plays its addictive. best thing is u dont need to put money in tbf the only thing money buys is skin and priogems. and u get them in game for doing stuff. its long winded and there is a lot to learn. spend your wishes wisely take time to learn things. once u hit adventure rank 16 its open world time people can help you things get way more interesting. pc has a version and its cross play mobile to pc.\n",
      "i have been playing this game for a bit over a year and these major updates dont disappoint far from it. i am looking forward to more quests and more characters although i feel as if this game is so expandable that the story wont finish for another 2 years. nonetheless i look forward to seeing the game in the finished story and playing through the story start to finish.\n",
      "i love the art style and the open world exploration. ive had this game for about a yr or so and it is by far one of my top favorite games. ive recommended a few friends to play this game and a lot of them absolutely love it. its good if you wanna play solo or play with others from around the world or in your region. its a great way to make friends too. highly recommend this game if you love open world games mixed with a lil bit of combat \n",
      "ive been playing genshin impact since it released on playstation and its a beautiful game. i highly recommend it to anyone. its got a little something for everyone ranging from sword fighting to magic powers to cooking food and even fishing. its an incredible game with a great story and breathtaking art think zelda breath of the wild with plenty of quests to do and they dont dont really push a pay to play or pay to win agenda in my opinion. give it a try if youre bored one day.\n",
      "ok the game was fun when i first played it. it was fun exploring but now theres nothing to do late game at all. plus the game is very problematic with its character design they refuse to represent darker skinned people and they refuse to add diversity in other areas as well. it basically makes all of the characters look the same and it gets boring. sumeru which is based off of south asia africa has maybe 2 characters that arent paper white. i used to love this game but now...\n",
      "i gotta tell ya your game is kinda boring once youve done every quest and open all chest around the map pls make your game fun to play again i still cant remember why i was so in with this game when i first start playing it but now i dont remember. im ar56 im so close to 60 i dunno what to do if im finally ar 60. if i start a new account its just tiring listening to the same voice and things they talk about. i give it a 5star cause it was fun playing it. it was the best game ive played\n",
      "overall the game is awesome but the problem is that we low end mobiles user dont have the some features in the game such as grass ice damage and bug with dvalin la signora yun jin and raidens shield. the lag is awful and it has to be fixed asap.\n",
      "lost 50 50 3 times in a row at around 70 80 pulls. won the fourth one at 45 when i wanted to actually lose for once. lost the next one again at 80. yeah not spending on this garbage. dont get me wrong the game is beautiful the soundtracks are nice the characters and their backstories info is well done the bosses are mostly fair for all ars but the rng is garbage. whether it be artifacts or wishes its just ridiculously unfair for an f2p player.\n",
      "its an amazing game with thousands of things to do not exadgurating and there are countless places to explore in the entire world and every character has a story to tell. my only problem is today 12 aug 2022 it just keeps closing the app saying tjere is a big and i need to update it once the developer fixes the bug\n",
      "i really like the 2.4 update. 10 out of 10 for putting shenhes mysterious backstory to the release of enkanomiya. the background music of enkanomiya and the music when youre in battle i am really into it. it became more exciting and at the same time mysterious and magical.\n",
      "i absolutely love this game the storyline and graphics are amazing so is the art but one thing thats bugging me is the fact that it isnt on xbox so i can only on my phone. if u can add genshin impact on to xbox that would be great\n",
      "genshin impact is very amazing. i thought my quality would be very low but turns out the opposite once you adjust to all the buttons you probably just maybe get a little addicted.\n",
      "ive never really been into games of any kind. but genshin really knew how to pull me in the environmental details are amazing even at the lowest graphics. background music is amazing and brings out the best of your experience it makes fights more exciting exploration more calming and it just draws you in in general. the character designs are all cool i dont think ill be quitting this game anytime soon. play this game if you can you wont regret it \n",
      "its okay a little overrated. graphics are nice if you use a pc instead of a phone because then you have to lower graphics to play the game smoothly without lag. it may just be my phone or the internet connection i have or both. another thing i dont like is how you have to install another app to get daily rewards. i dont play the game except to redeem them not really all that fun tbh. but thats my experience im sure many others would beg to differ but its meh.\n",
      "i love this game the gameplay is addicting especially the elemental combos you can pull off more than that though is the lore from the deep rich grandios lore for the world and gods to the smaller more manageable but equally cool character stories you unlock by befriending the characters you use alot everything is so wildly interesting and i love it also you can win without paying i never paid a dime \n",
      "i love the game but may i suggest adding a skip button so you could skip the dialogue i love the lore but sometimes i want to skip through the dialogue and it takes a long time to do it manually a skip button would help a lot. other than that this game is fun.\n",
      "i changed my review because of the recent changes. im glad that they taking fixes on graphical issues in oppo devices especially my curent phone. as well as their taking step up in the games which the sumeru update make me overjoyed on the quality of it. still its sad to say i cant fully experience it with graphical issues like no grass no dmg text no ice bridge and etc. thanks hoyoverse for improvement and waiting it for more fixes. thats the only i want for them to improve.\n",
      "2nd review. after the recent update ver 3.0 the game become way more laggy and starts to stutter constantly which ruins my experience in the game. before the update the i have no issue with the performance so im assumed the issue have something to do with the latest 3.0 patch. hope the developers will do something about this.\n",
      "the game itself is teriffic and amazing i would highly recommend but there is one major problem which is that at high adventure rank there is basically half an hour of content each day and thats it also the developers need to buff some characters like for example diluc and keqing the new characters out shine them by far but like me people like to have fun with different characters which is currently very difficult as old characters are hardly viable anymore.\n",
      "amazing story and great amount of effort put into graphics lore music fighting and puzzle mechanics. its well optimized and loads fast on phone. i removed a star hopefully temporarily. latest update is breathtaking inspired by india arabia. most characters have a very light skintone despite foreign names. its very disturbing changing a colour on a model is easy. i implore you to re chose appropriate skintones even for playable characters eg. kusanali . it comes across as discriminatory.\n",
      "genshin impact is a delightful feast that grows every year. outstanding soundtrack smooth combat and beautiful visuals. mobile version runs very good and is crossplay. every year a major elementa area is released. throughout the year events enemies music characters weapons and more are released.\n",
      "this is such a very cool game the music is epic and so are the sceneries the fighting style is so good and the voice lines too. its abit laggy since the sumeru release with the large gb and stuff so its not recommended for potato phones. maybe making the storage smaller but overall i love this game. please keep up the good work \n",
      "i love this game really i do. the story is great the animation for big scenes are absolutely beautiful. i mean seriously this game has great graphics. but there are big issues in this game that others have criticized time and time again that hoyoverse simply has not acknowledged seriously. the diversity issue especially with the new sumeru update artifact system as well has been a huge complaint and difficulty has been a huge issue in inazuma. good game hoyoverse just wont listen.\n",
      "the addition of sumeru is by far the best with the new animals places and puzzle mechanics i cant wait to explore everything right away and complete it also the background music never disappoints. now currently at 20 exploration. \n",
      "beautiful game and very fun to play. building comps with different characters is satisfying. gacha aspect can be a bit daunting and you wont get every character you want unless you plan for it but still manageable. anniversary rewards were okay after they listened to some of the feedback. looking forward to future updates.\n",
      "3.0 sumeru was great the art music good as always but the archon quest was a disappointment to much nonsense and repeating the same thing over and over was a waste of time and annoyin i also thought that when sumeru comes out the resin cap will increase but it didnt and that is really bad now that we have 2 talent materials added and 2 artifacts added and weapon materials and 2 bosses do you think players can upgrade a character with only 160 and please balance the game buff diluc\n",
      "i tried on multiple occasions to get into this game it failed every single time to suck me in. weather it be its story or just open world environments its failed to grab me. the art work is amazing the graphics amazing thats all it really has going for it for me personally. the combat is too slow compared to other similar games out there now these days tof for example is much better combat imo and feels way more rewarding to explore in tof than genshin. overrated in my opinion.\n",
      "this game is really amazing the graphics are really high quality and the characters lore and gameplay are flawless only 1 problem that i have it takes up wayyy too much space on my device although i cant download anything for the time being the game itself makes up for it \n",
      "everything about this game is amazing from graphics characters storylines you name it you can see that the devs worked hard by the little details theyve placed. although the game is great i just have one tiny problem. the updates. im thankful for the updates the devs release but everytime i play the game i gotta wait for the update to be downloaded so that means more waiting time. it gets really annoying but hey new updates right but other than that the game is great. 5 5 \n",
      "from the perspective of a low end smartphone gaming 4gb ram is enough to experience the whole mondstadt region 1st chapter quest in the lowest specs possible. then further down you might experience increasing stutters and lags as liyue and inazuma fills in the limit of the ram. but its a whole new experience for a newbie like me in the world of 3prpg .\n",
      "the game is all good. it also exceeded my expectations in certain areas such as map size and small details. the only problem is lag issues. in india the ping is too high which hinders the performance. i have been playing on asia server. if this is fixed the quality will definitely improve\n",
      "genshin is the best open world game on mobile at the moment. with the anime style immersive gameplay and graphics with the classic adventure and explorer features its a great rpg. it has far too many mechanics reactions and calculations along with puzzles and combat\n",
      "its a good game with lots of puzzles and adventure very addicting game but theres things that make me upset like 1.power creeping its a problem not most people care about but for some people there favorite character will slowly be unusable in the coming months and new characters will thrive in the meta making people uninterested in playing. 2.not listening to the community hoyovers is known to not listen to the players especially with character bugs fix or character buffs they never listen.\n",
      "pretty unplayable until you roll the less than one percent chance of a 5 starred main dps character. you will be locked out of exploring new content and be forced to downgrade enemies sacrificing the experience and gameplay. i was only able to enjoy the game after getting klee otherwise this would be a 2.5.\n",
      "the game is really good. i really like the character designs the events the fighting style of characters and enemies but theres just one problem that is pretty big. theres barely any diversity. there are only three confirmed dark skinned characters in the game. plus every playable character is not overweight nor underweight. so there just isnt enough diversity in the game\n",
      "it is a wonderful game i love the storyline and the characters. it does take a lot of space though which could be a problem. but i absolutely love it and want to continue playing it until the story is finished. if i could id rate it a 4.5 5 but i chose 5 5 because this game is just chefs kiss. 3\n",
      "the game is amazing the graphics the characters the quests the story are all very entertaining the game is quite addicting however to level up characters you need a lot of materials that most of the time are very hard to get also the artifacts are extremely difficult to obtain to clear the domains to get them you have to work very hard often they arent good artifacts or they ones we want so it can be very stressful so if they could make it easier it would make the game more enjoyable\n",
      "this game is amazing it can keep you entertained for hours has beautiful graphics and doesnt even have ads. i like the open world factor the characters landscapes voice acting all of it i really recommend it unless you have a not very good phone. although you can also get it on pc. overall great game ive turned it down to one star because im sick of the blatant whitewashing and lack of black representation. fix it.\n",
      "this game is absolutely phenomenal. from the graphics to the story and characters every thing is just amazingly put together. it is definitely worthy of a five star rating however once you get near end game theres less to do but even still you should be able to find someway to entertain yourself whether it be with friends or just alone. i know im biased because ive played for a while now but even still its an incredible game \n",
      "i love the game its graphics storylines characters everything. something just concerns me how it needs a lot of space. i totally understand that its because of the map graphics but atleast make the gb needed lower.\n",
      "amazing gameplay and top notch graphics. one improvement i would love if you made would be to increase the resin count to 200 it would really help even though it would just be a little bit. edit the new update sumeru is still somewhat laggy some bug fixes would be great \n",
      "i have always loved playing genshin impact because of its amazing updates from time to time the storyline the unique characters the bosses and so much more. really recommend playing it especially it is still playable even if my graphic settings being low lowest.\n",
      "its a really good game. the creativity and everything is spot on. fun to play with friends family or just alone. the only issue is the lack or responsibility twards skin tones. they make some newer characters very pale they never make poc people as much anymore and the community of genshin has been saying that for years.\n",
      "i know a lot of people say that genshin impact is just a cheap botw copy and yes i do agree it is definitely inspired by zelda. however its still a great game it has a cool storyline great graphics and its music is soooooo calming overall i say its a great game.\n",
      "the game is great its been running good too. barely any lagging or skipping. good graphics like a anime. its different too so i like that. and its got side missions too or you could run around and explore the game is definitely fun. good job \n",
      "so uhm im a pc and mobile player who is ar 57 and have invested a lot of time in this game. the scenery is incredible and the world is very pretty. the combat is pretty fun where you mix different elements to get different elementsl reactions. my only gripe an an endgame player is that there isnt an endgame. once you reach a certain point all you do is log in do your dailies then log out. theres nothing else to do and im saying this with 100 exploration. my advice is take the game slowly.\n",
      "good game with alot of potential. i some times have a hard time signing in and you cant make multiple accounts off one email when signing in through google. i would also love if it was easier to get playable characters through wish i rarely get them. also if we could get razor or diluc though story progression thatd be awesome. fix add these fetures and its 5 stars from me.\n",
      "overall the game is good. the graphics gameplay story and all that. i just hope theres a way in a smartphone users to customize the buttons. make it easier for us to play the game. thank you. especially a dark mode of loading screen.\n",
      "i love genshin so much. character designs r great although there are some issues with respectful cultural representation. but the main problem here is the huge storage it requires. which game even requires 16gb of storage im sure hoyoverse can work something out. my 128gb phone cant take it no more much less those with 64gb had to delete the game a few times already bc of storage problems\n",
      "great game. great soundtrack good graphic and visual scenery. scheduled event at its finest. new story quest side quest and new character. decent reward for the player but still acceptable. grinding stuff is fun for beginner but kind of harsh later in the game. the character and weapon collection gacha are systematic but a little bit expensive rng equipment artifact that is kind of irrelevant rng material drop that is fair but kind of lacking. btw the sumeru 3.0 patch is awesome\n",
      "this game is amazing i love the character designs the storyline it is one of the best games i have ever played though it takes alot of storage it is worth it if you are planning to download it and dont mind to lose a few apps and photos then do it as soon as possible \n",
      "wow the game is very amazing the graphics so fabulous i love the game very much i suggest this game to my friends and family my phone very not lagging while playing my phone really can withstand the ultra high graphics i love the story the music is the most bestest i would like to travel with paimon in real life i hope paimon can be playable character.\n",
      "mondstadt and liyue are great introductions to the game with newer areas inuzuma and sumeru gives us a more challenging experience. not to mention the music is what enhance this game to another level for each region have its own unique musical style and tone aesthetically the world building and characters are astonishing both serve well for the theme of the open world experience additionally each character have its own individual speciality which just makes the experience more enjoyable\n",
      "its a great game though it took 4 hours to finish loading when i first got it. im not exaggerating.. it took four whole hours once it finished the voice acting was rather glitchy and it was just super laggy but after the first part it was alright \n",
      "i am now considered a veteran player to the fanbase sitting at ar 56. this game is no longer enjoyable. i found myself at a distaste for the lack of model variety. the game and characters are still very well done. but theres a major lack of communication between the company and players. playing the game is like doing homework for school theres characters who are extremely similar its funny. a lack of diversity for something thats based off the real world with real cultures and religions.\n",
      "nice graphic and story but it has bad multiplayer system if this game supposed to be single player game then the balance of the enemies is not balance and the grinding aspect in this game is too much to handle and in order to complete spiral abyss player need nice artifact which is take long time to get 1 and its really really time consuming and not worth to presue or play this game and the other thing is player need some certain character to enjoy playing story like op shield buff and stuff.\n",
      "one of the best open world gacha game for few years. i still hoping more mechanism of play style interactions with playable characters more importantly i want the traveller can resonating each skills with different elements the burst is electro elemental skill geo or something like that.\n",
      "this is absolutely the best game i have ever played in my life grand graphics experience great stories and lots of stuff to do... although its missing some stuff like being able to ride a creature...have a pet beside you... and other stuff... but overall this game is a great one indeed\n",
      "i absolutely love this game i have been playing since it came out and im very pleased with it. the game is constantly coming out with new characters and adding more parts to the huge world i love the story that you experience as well. this game has lots to offer from characters teams builds and more. \n",
      "this the best game i have ever played.the best thing about this game is that it has mind blowing level graphics and music.but for in lower budget devices you wont be happy with the performance.that is the main issue you cant play this game in lower budget devices but i am sure that if you ever play this game you will get addicted. overall this game is best.\n",
      "fantastic good fun for almost 2 years now a beautiful immersive world surprisingly complex and rewarding combat and every single character you get to play is awesome. do not become addicted obsessed with gambling real life money trying to get a specific character. patience and gameplay is all you need support the developers because theyre doing an amazing job. but you can do that with a couple not a couple hundred . peace \n",
      "how to make genshin 5 stars 1. double all primogem sources daily commissions quests chests achievements except for events 2. add more teleporters or give the player a magical creature to ride for faster travel 3. add offline lan mode cloud save upload so players can play genshin offline 4. an option to have unnessesary dialog such as the story be automatically skipped 5. less characters that use thier abilities then are swapped off asap 6. changing meta 7. more puzzles in the open world\n",
      "this game is really good but takes up a lot of storage and once downloaded grows from around 100mb to 9 gb. edit now from around 7 months later it grows from 700mb to 13gb. for mobile players graphics can be poor. rewards in game are low and it makes the game harder to play for free to play players. edit. once you start playing it can be very addicting and compared to other games the characters are well designed just be wary on how much you spend\n",
      "missions may be hard primogems may be hard to get and to earn but at the end is all worth it this game is worth playing for eternity the new characters trailers make it 100 more exciting. thank you genshin programmers and characters designers and anyone else who helped to make this game better each version.\n",
      "please make custom hud button setting ......... its very needed to mobile player in sumeru map you may use the special feature to make your move easy but sometime its will very useless because that button will disturbing you when you want to swipe the screen at war with monsters that matters also make crash move low dps because the button doesnt in the right position you want. please tell me if you was made the custom setting i will back to give 5 stars and install to enjoy again \n",
      "ive played this game for a while and finding more and more problem about this game. most annoying of them all is the combat instead of having fun with the elemental reactions i first thought when i saw the game the combat feels more like a chore and rank up quest is a nightmare and its mandatory as you have to progress to go explore the other map.this makes my game experience ruined as what i like the most is the exploring and solving puzzles part.also 5 star character rates are abyssmal.\n",
      "i really like this game. i played it on console and found it on the app store. but there is one problem. whenever i load in after a few minutes the game freezes up and i have to restart the game. it doesnt ever work for more then 2 minutes before it completely freezes up. can someone help me find the problem i did file verification it said to repair still doesnt work.\n",
      "besides all the problematic character designs which is indeed a serious matter i would like to add the fact that the quests are so time consuming for no reason. some small ones have such heavy forced dialog and you just cant for the love of god remember even 2 of its unrelated to the game whatsoever points.\n",
      "hi the new update makes the game jittering like every 2 seconds. my device can run the game on high graphics and decent stable fps before the update. some players who has different device also experiencing this issue. i hope you guys fix this. thanks.\n",
      "pretty good game and its definitely no longer the botw clone it used to be. i do wish it was easier to get primogems though. most players cant even do one pull per day and thats quite absurd knowing that it costs 160 primogems for one pull and you get only 60 a day mostly. for a gacha game it definitely lacks an f2p friendly gacha system. but it still has good graphics catching storyline and overall great exploration. p.s. make it so resin regenerates faster \n",
      "no endgame content. world is nice but super long wait times between content updates means it gets stale kinda quick. coop needs improvements cant even craft items at the alchemy table. still missing a lot of quality of life improvements one of the more important ones being able to use condensed resin on 40 resin cost bosses.\n",
      "been playing since a month after it launched. love it the lore the characters the music and the scenery its amazing great game where your only problem would be resin and mora sometimes xd totally recommend \n",
      "been playing since version 1.1 easily one of my favorite games. it can be a little janky and theres too much grinding for how much resin we get in a day. but with the new qol update coming with 3.0 and if a couple more get added im sure thatll be much less of an issue.\n",
      "i had quite a lot of fun. then i hit somewhere around 4 minutes and 17 seconds of gameplay and immediately headed out. you see theres no controller support on android. i know that this is a small issue but im not a huge fan of touch controls. i really hope it gets changed sometime.\n",
      "okay it used to be a 1 star review and i probably should have waited until anniversary but man genshin has been so good recently. weve been getting fire updates for 4 patches straight starting from irodori fest up to sumeru the quests were interesting the rewards were satisfying and the overall quality of the game has significantly improved. it made me fall in love with the game once again. good job hoyoverse.\n",
      "this game is aesthetically beautiful combat system is nice combo with different elements . love the exploration of the world. the problem is lack of communication. since they reach 1b they stop communicating to the community. they refuse to release make a balance patch or tweak.\n",
      "the game is perfect and i enjoy playing it. if only it was possible to move data to other server i wouldnt have any problems with ping and network connections anymore... please add this option if its possible. thank you \n",
      "its great ive been playing thus game ever since it got out. probably september 2020 ive had so much memories in this game it gave me so much friends. but ever since the start of 2022 i lost interest in the game. it was maybe because it would give me the worst artifacts which made me waste all my time. i came back to this game this august and saw how much of my friends quit the game and that some of them reached ar 60. that was my dream too to reach ar 60 i lost interest in the story\n",
      "ive played all mmorpg games..and this one has the best battle system and storyline. my only problem is that im not particularly a fan of anime and childish graphics. maybe the developers could develop a realistic graphics fantasy or medieval theme type like genshin impact battle system and open world. id play it forever. this one i like it but theyre too childish haha\n",
      "ok genshin its almost that time of the year again. if you cant even give the bare minimum of a free standard banner 5 star character you deserve whatever wrath comes your way. its not even a good gift for most of the player base. however its amazing for people like me with 40 5 stars who have yet to get their favorite character and the perfect way to bring in new players.\n",
      "love the game the story line graphics character and many more things but the only down side is the game takes a lot of storage and you need a good phone to play it on my phone this game alone is taking 17 gb its a lot and i hope you try to reduce the amount of storage occupied by game thanks.\n",
      "its a good game with amazing characters but i got bored of it quickly. its sort of repetitive in a way where everyday it feels like youre on a task to do the same things youve been doing over and over again. i think it would be more enjoyable if you actually pay attention and get into the storyline. decent game \n",
      "this game is nice but its not new player friendly because of all the event thing. its a story driven game and not having the chance to participate to an event will robbed you of some pieces of the lore. also being a solo player because i dont want to play with other players its hard there some quest you need to achieve only when you play co op. at least lets us have some options to download participate in past events. the game is good though thats why i want to able play it the way i want\n",
      "okay so ive been playing this game for a long while now 512 days according to hoyolab . it was one of the games that i thought i would never get bored of since i was playing constantly on a daily for the first 11 months or so. turns out the repetitive gameplay and the daily grind for as little as 60 primos does get boring after a while. i still love this game a lot and do suggest it to pretty much all my friends i just wish there were more to do.\n",
      "this game is peaceful and absolutely beautiful but i would really enjoy it more if it was on xbox. i only have this game on my phone and i just love the game but my storage cant handle the updates. i dont get how you could have this largely developed game on a phone but not on an xbox that can take the storage of the game better than a phone. im asking if you hoyo if you could please just make a change. please add this amazing game to the xbox community. xbox community ourselves need it.\n",
      "the new update of sumeru i liked it a lot. they added a lot of new things like food things characters exploration and new type of way of travelling. also i liked sumeru since it can actually be challenging.\n",
      "hello once again genshin devs first of all thank you for the latest fruity lore content you brought us this version. the new nation is so surprising and also the new characters. all new stuffs are too awesome. also thank you for the optimization that you have made for android platforms... it really helped a lot to explore the map with less lags and screen stutters. all in all version 3.0 is a total blast continue to amaze us hoyoverse \n",
      "i want to love this game and i have for the past two years but now its unplayable. lag on mobile is to a point where i cant even do my daily commissions. i was so excited to explore sumeru but i can barely even take two steps in without the game performing at the same speed of a lame badger. i just want a switch port\n",
      "the game is very fun many things to explore quests or lore i enjoy it a lot. since a new nation has come out theres a lot of new places for early players to explore and get more rewards from theres new things to achieve and new characters to meet and try out in total it is a very fun game it takes some time to understand game mechanics but its all worth it. people are complaining about pronouncing issues in sumeru but said were overreacting when we said so elsewhere. sometimes laggy tho\n",
      "everything is great about this game just you will wait a while depending on wifi and your phones storage before playing and besides the random audio cracking the game is pretty good but i recommend getting the pc or ps4 ps5 version if you want a smooth experience but if you dont have a pc or ps4 ps5 this it the best alternative.\n",
      "ive been playing this game for nearly a year now. it has been a really fun experience and i really like it.sadly a big problem for me is that there are barely any actually dark skinned charakters. even the darker ones still have quite light skin. i would really like some really dark skinned charakters in the future.\n",
      "absolutely loving the game rn really good graphics great action combat... i just wish that they change the commission pattern by not giving us the same enemies to fight all the time... other than that the game looks good\n",
      "this game is getting more broken each day when im using my s9 the game would just have everything turned pink the textures of trees and everything goes pink i feel like it has something to do with the environment settings from lowest to highest but anytime it has pink stuff messing the textures of attacks and trees and enemies and effects basically everything..it will lag so badly and everything goes laggy to the point ill move every 1 second can you guys please fix this this game is bad zz\n",
      "the side quest in sumeru definitely deserve a praise because it doesnt hv the sme pattern like side quest in other region and it actually not annoying. the puzzles are good and creative plus the npcs designs in sumeru are beautiful. the only thing i disappointed is theres barely comic relief in the archon quest. the plot twist when we have to choose number 4 only nilou dance and tighnari sassy attitude are the only part i found amusing.\n",
      "story 10 10 animation 10 10 music 10 10 user interface 10 10 controls 8 10 technical 8 10 requirements 8 10 so far i like this game thus its calming and soothing background music makes my stress loss away. no pay to win method. even if there are fps drops considering my device havent reach the minimum requirements i manage to enjoy the game itself. may traveller be reunited with his her brother someday. ad astra abyssosque \n",
      "unending grinding with the same enemies again and again i liked the exploration part of the game more but the game keeps throwing you into meaningless battles so it ruined that too. it feels like you waste your time without feeling like progressing.\n",
      "its a great game with beautiful art and an interesting story. however there are 2 brown people out of like 45 characters. the lack of diversity is really sad. especially after playing for over a year\n",
      "the game is getting better now it doesnt lag as much but the only problem i have now is that when im doing my story quest to get the gliding license the ring wont appear for some reason. this could be temporary but please fix this \n",
      "love it despite being hard. it can be p2p and f2p depending on which you would like but being a f2p might need a lot of time of grinding and waiting but dont make that as a hindrance to play the game. i dare you its fun and exploring new characters and areas give joys and lore is very great and exciting although cliff hanging sometimes.\n",
      "a small review because i can only write 500 words. graphics they are great. story is good but sumeru feels like its dragging on and most characters are uninteresting. weapons i almost dont have a chance to get copies same goes for the characters. artifacts its still the same issue i cant get good artifacts. leveling a character is easy same goes for talent. world first when i start playing it wasnt so great but with the sumeru update the world feels like its somewhat alive.\n",
      "this game is really good especially the story its so interesting and i love the designs and the details they put in the characters and the nations i personally like this game and if youre interested in puzzles adventure etc.. i think this game is a good choice 3\n",
      "this game is amazing and when my sis told me about it i just didnt install but decided to give it a chance and after 5 minutes it was super fun and entertained me more than enough. imagine that the traveler has to leave teyvat but is stopped by the archons who try to convince them to stay. and he walks down in the loading screen to get to khanriah. then they got their powers back and defeated the unknown god and got her powers and had a choice to become evil or good.\n",
      "ive been playing this game since version 2.6. totally satisfied with everything else except that i havent got any weapon reward after defeating the boss for more than a couple of months now. its really annoying cos ive been wanting to forge a weapon for my character for so long \n",
      "ive never seen a rpg game with dedicated devs like in genshin. the scenarios music characters and regions are rich colorful and keep on giving growing and fleshin out with every update that passes. truly a work of art in all of its forms. ive always played on pc and i can finally play comfortably on my phone and i cant get even more excited about this. thank you mihoyo \n",
      "after downloading genshin on my phone it lags in the way of any time i hit an enemy it literally deducts no life from them. no matter what move or who i use. i literally cannot fight in the domains because i will always lose due to this. it also has been seriously delaying my ability to switch character and is getting to a point where i no longer want to play. how can i improve my stats when im getting screwed rn the app is just taking up space on my phone that i could use for a useful game.\n",
      "the best open world rpg out of everything i like the storyline and characters design and it have so much content to play. i personally like the games lore the most cause i think its fun to learn more time to time. anyways although its laggy sometimes for me but i think overall its good to play.\n",
      "the game is really fun however some of us mobile players out there have a slight issue if you can please add a hud option where you customize your skill button position so we mobile users can freely move or have a more better experience on playing this game this is by far my most important thing to say since i have been playing this game for 1 month its been really tough for me having not to customize my button position over all its a very great game. \n",
      "as of the 2.8 update game is slowly improving. things still need to be tweaked especially qol updates. i cant recommend this to new players because i worry about whether or not theyll be able to farm the materials needed for certain characters especially inazuma.\n",
      "started at late 2.5 and now its ver. 3.0.. i must say that i do enjoy the storylines and the exploration overall however i suggest add more end game contents to avoid boedom cuz once u have finished everything it becames a chore to do dailies.. nonetheless the regions especially the newly added sumeru is very fun to explore \n",
      "its a great game lovely graphics and awesome gameplay. my biggest drawback is no controller support for android. they have it on iphone and for pc but not android. other than that i love the game.\n",
      "i rate it a 4 this is because it is quite the grind for artifacts and we dont get a lot of resin. for the f2p it can be frustrating. but other than that its fun especially if you ignore the gacha and play for just exploring and story.\n",
      "its a very fun and interesting game and there is always something new added to the game i really like it there is always good character the only thing is when u log in with bad internet u start to glitch and the world starts to become lagged and the enemies will spawn when u get good internet but overall this game is good i love it and the character designs and world designs are very good .\n",
      "thats the best game ever its my favourite game its easy to use and you can play it with friends im thankful for the developer my only problem was i have to gain primogem to wish which is not easy to find so i cant get characters easily and if u wish 10 wishes i didnt get a character after 20 wishes that pissed me off alittle and that doesnt change the fact that its my favourite game\n",
      "i absolutely adore the game ive been pretty much playing since launch and the game has come far and improved in many ways but i still think theres room for improvement with the lack of diversity and representation especially in the new area sumeru im holding out hope that well see more diverse skin tones in the future\n",
      "so addictive this game is so much fun. you have main quests side quests daily quests and more. there are different builds for each character. this game should not be free. i would expect the amount of content this game provides from a pay to play game.\n",
      "decent app. the problem in my opinion is primogems are really hard to get basically when unlocking a waypoint it gives you 5 primogems but it keeps lagging everytime i unlocked a new waypoint also everytime i lag it shows these pink weird things in my view and could you please raise 5star chances just for a bit it would help alot.\n",
      "this game is an absolute banger. i dont think i need to say anything.. first of all the design next is the environment the enemies the gameplay all the enjoyment you can find in one game i show all respect to the developers \n",
      "genshin impact is such a fun game. i used to play it whenever i could. almost every second of my free time. but i have a problem. it takes too much space when i was clearing my files. i went to app and oh boy genshin impact took 1 3 of my space. it used 20 22gb so although i love this game please take this into consideration. \n",
      "awesome game the story the quest the everything im looking forward to it but i have a little problem with this game it sometimes glitch or lag even tho my internets fast i hope you fix that i also missed most of the cutscenes events i really hope we can have it again tvt.\n",
      "its okay if you wanna play it but be wary of the gacha it can suck you dry like a succubus. also hoyoverse still gotta fix somethings like resin and the artifact system. at high level its just too boring to play the game as new characters need atleast decent artifacts to reach potential but the same are rng based and require resin to get which limits how much farming can be done for them. so you reach a stage where you want to play new characters but its too much work. other than that its ok\n",
      "this is a great game to play. i like the open world expected and the story line i also like that we can create our own world inside the teacup which its really cool i like some of the characters way of fighting and the characters design. things i think that the game creator should add to the game is more dark skin characters and i also think that they should focus more on putting voices everytime the characters talk cause sometimes they dont do that and it cam get a little bit exhausting .\n",
      "good game but its kinda boring but fun at the same time really less on rewards but thatll only matter if your character your pulling is almost coming cannot wait for anniversary event login. also cool graphics cute hot pretty handsome characters the lore is actually making me pretty interested in it too bad i skip it since its boring and i dont know why. i believe on this game thatll be even better. also hope i get ganyu thanks genshin if you gave me your blessing hehe \n",
      "the best game i ever played.i love playing co op with my friends. the puzzles and quests are fun and the characters are fun to interact with. the serenetia pot is so fun to build and i cant wait to check out the new update today.\n",
      "almost a year playing this game now. so many things to do with this game world quest that is not listed but will get achievement generous freemogem once finished. superb graphic environment excellent soundtracks. in depth story line that rich with politics humanity power and so on. only 1 exasperating part every time new update the version is not auto update with huawei phone. please make it easier with harmony os in the new version \n",
      "the game is actually 5 stars. but the main problem here is domains... im 100 sure that you dont have equal chances on substats. the amount of time and resources spent on artifacts only to come out with flat stats and no actual useful stats is ludicrous.\n",
      "this game is so fun and enjoyable. i love its lore and gaming style. we have little bit problems like full map needs so big time to relase and community is creating low difficultys becayse they want fair to play i guess but we need more difficulty more action and more enjoyable from this game because we can see huge potential in it.\n",
      "man i havnt played a game like this on a mobile davice that actualy works and looks good the art the music makes me feel free and enjoy. i like this game because it takes mobile games to a new level if i were to see a video about this game without know were its from id think its a consol game or pc never mobile. it is so much fun how you can be free the characters are unique and the weapons are epic. this game is worth a five star and id like ti see how it evolves \n",
      "great game. awesomw graphics. the new update caused lots of fps drops on my new phone. when i just downloaded the game everything was smooth. the new update just made a bit of a problem in my gameplay. but everything is great nonetheless.\n",
      "i love this game so much but there is only 1 problem this is my first time playing and i realy liked it but after some time my game was loading in perfectly and crashes in the first few seconds..not saying that its only this game i have full internet conection but its happening to all my games i hope this gets fixed soon idk what is happening.other than that i definitly recomed getting this game all the features and its beautiful vibrent colors i would give it a five stars if it can get fixed.\n",
      "as an ar 57 game is fun especially the lore that keeps me going.i would give 5 stars if you fix these problems. firstly the wishing system 160primogems for one wish when you only get 60 per day from daily commission if you are an ar 57 and above player. please make a change for more accumulation of primogems daily. next the condensed resin limitations. only 5 condensed resin are allowed in your storage. its really not enough for end game players who mostly use it and not normal resin.\n",
      "the game itself storyline character personalities gameplay everything is really good. however the game def needs more diversity. as someone who studies history its kinda upsetting to see characters based off of real life people who have dark skin such as kandake made as light as me a white person. representation is not something genshin should have a problem with as they did perfectly fine with other characters like yunjin. not sure what happened with the sumeru characters \n",
      "after expierencing tower of fantasy genshin has started to feel sluggish in its movement controls comparatively the new element only reacts with the already power elements leaving anemo and geo to its own playstyle and no level cap increase so the game is still pretty stale in gameplay however the new sumeru area is absolutely beautiful and well designed so far the story feels relatively adult and not quite so harsh as the inasuma line and is very much worth the look game needs more game\n",
      "believe me its an amazing game. all the problems that people are telling in their reviews are the problems that are caused due to their devices internet services etc. this game has almost no technical bugs problems. you can play it as a completely free to play game though if you decide to spend on it then obviously its gonna make the game easier convenient for you. and obviously if you are playing it as a free to play then you have to grind a lot. thats what a gacha game is after all.\n",
      "this is a very good game to play a lot of interesting storyline lore great characters great visuals great voice acting recommend chinese voicelines and many more ive been playing for over a year now and i still have not stopped playing its addictive. its a f2p game but there are options for goldfishing and whaling i personally am a goldfish lol but back to the topic great game but there are 2 halfs of the fandom the one you wanna avoid and the awesome part of the fandom \n",
      "the game is really fun overall but the amount of storage taken up from my phone is really bad. i hope hoyoverse knows that most of their players are mobile players and do something about it. another is the lack of diversity and skin color the characters have.\n",
      "i really do love this game the thing is that the game is pretty hard to improve in which in my eyes is good but if you dont like to work hard keep in mind that this is not one of the games where you get everything easily the game itself is beautiful and interesting with a lot of quests and beautiful creatures i personally recommend this game very much.\n",
      "still boring after the sumeru update. the sumeru archon quest is utter garbage with no exciting fighting gameplay experience. dialogue goes for hours and hours and only less than a minute of actual gameplay experience. i play the game of course only for the reason that this is the only game of its kind. but i want the developers to be more creative about the gameplay aspect of the game.\n",
      "this game is so addicting and the gameplay is so fun the map is large and there are lots of things to do in this game i wish they would give better rewards for leveling up your adventure rank giving only 3 normal wishes on ar 60 is dumb i play the game so much to get to the max level and only get 3 wishes insane. still i adore this game so of course gonna give it 5 stars.\n",
      "story is decent characters are great music is amazing exploration is fun events great 5 star rates are bad artifacts farm is rng hell current end game content is lacking. i suggest you play through the first two regions monstadt liyue before deciding whether to keep playing.\n",
      "its a very good game to play if youre bored at home or if you just want to kill time and or just enjoy the story and characters. downside is if you finish the story quests game theres nothing really left to do except do some commissions. and the commissions is kinda repitetive and thats what makes is kinda boring. overall very good game \n",
      "any botw fan can tell how solid of a game genshin impact is truly a gem of a game. everythings great gameplay wise but on mobile there are some performance issues one that bothers me the most is how hot the device gets in 60fps mode if hoyoverse can fix that it would be so awesome but a game of this caliber on mobile is awesome already. and also i wish there was a sea server so we could have lower ping.\n",
      "very fun i like the sound effects the realistic music and real life interactions. it makes me feel more free and gives me the chance to discover a whole new world without moving. highly recommended it gets pretty boring if the game is getting stale cause of no update and youre in the middle of a banner you dont like. but other than that great game though i would really want it if they improve the co op system. that way its easier to meet other people and hang out with others.\n",
      "this game is amazing i enjoy the open world experience and the design. one thing is that the game tends to freeze at points. i also have noticed alot of problems in sumeru lag issues is one example\n",
      "i love this game. the story characters character designs music very good are the best there are problems like artifact farming which is repetetive and becomes boring after a lot of times bugs just report it and they will fix it and give compensations . also there are a lot of interesting events and the developers are generous in giving primogems not much in late game though \n",
      "far too much investment into the game to be worth your time. however my biggest complaint has just been semi fixed with the new artifact strong boxes. giving mihoyo a 2 star for actually addressing the issue after what took them a year to finally change.\n",
      "too much puzzles on the montage events. had to logout check youtube then go back to the game to clear 2 character montages. but when i got to mona. i had enough. ended up playing diablo immortal instead. no puzzles. a very disappointing event.\n",
      "currently only the app 800mb can be moved to an sd card while the data 17gb cant be which is the stuff it installs one youre in the app. if there could be a way in game to move the data to an sd that would be greatly appreciated because my phone barely has any storage left.\n",
      "im a mobile player. before the new update my graphic can go highest but mostly i use lower graphic and its working very smooth and just fine. but since the new update it start lagging and glitch i also got kicked out from the game. i hope you can fix this because its so hard to play. if this continues i dont feel enjoy to play and and i gotta delete the game by force.\n",
      "since new update today all i get is force closing after i press begin screen. cleared cache and did repair 2 times said it was fine. im not uninstalling and reinstalling a 15gb game because of this. will change my review when fixed. never ever had a problem before with this game. disappointing\n",
      "bro im telling yall this game is perfect it has graphics that are out of thus world and rarely feels like a game i installed on my phone. edit ok so as a game its amazing but the diversity is lacking i still think its nice to play and fun but i do think they should atleast try and fix their poor designs.\n",
      "very cool and has a lot of beautiful graphics but it takes a lot of storage if you play on mobile but overall very fun. but with the future updates coming i dont have any storage and cant log onto my pc with my gmail account so can you change that please.\n",
      "this game does not seem to like me. it says every 10 wishes im supposed to get a 4 star or higher...but i get nothing and i have been saving and wishing for the past 2 months witch still gives me nothing. the past 2 months i was able to make almost 18 wishes. i used them all and only got a 3 star and below. last on some of the quests i cant do co op mode unless i finish them witch are hard im only on adventure rank 45 and i am weak because some of my characters can only acend when inazuma..\n",
      "honestly a beautiful game cool to see many different cultures and their practices through this game. unique characters my personal favorite is raiden shogun and free roam. a huge map and many areas to explore and still growing. and beautiful scenery. love this game. keep working hard mihoyo and thank you to the voice actors. amazing so far. edit disappointed that the sumeru characters are mostly light skinned. isnt it based off of india very disappointing mihoyo.\n",
      "i love this game so much. yes there is no endgame content yes the artifactinf and wishing system could be better but you fall in love with the amazing story line graphics characters and so much more. this game is not meant for grinding all day and i really enjoy playing. the soundtrack is amazing \n",
      "incredible game been playing for over a year and im still hooked. i only have 2 issues with the game. 1 storage size game soze almost doubles with every major update soon mobile players will be left behind and a lot of people will be unable to continue the game. 2 the misrepresentation swana cultures in sumeru and the lack of representation in a game that is meant to display a world with several diverse cultures yet only has light skinned and lightly tan characters. do better.\n",
      "this app is amazing. its full of fun quests and has an amazing storyline. it has a bunch of characters to choose from. im not sure why people are saying there is a glitch because im pretty far and its just fine fore me. i would rate it higher then 5 star if i could. this is an amazing game\n",
      "the game graphics are so good and the game content is so neat and fun plus the characters look so cute i love this game. made my summer holiday fun. it works well on a tablet with excellent resolution.\n",
      "while the game is indeed amazing especially the soundtracks and the world teyvat there is a lot of small things that annoy me such as gacha artifact rng redundant dailies lack of qol updates management of the game and a lot more.\n",
      "really fun game. it has a neat story breath of the wild style exploration and fun combat mechanics. its also a gacha game and comes with the usual pitfalls. the rewards you get from quests and events in this game are worse than any other gacha game ive played. this means a lot of grind especially for late game players. im also not sure why the android version doesnt have controller support playing on mobile without that is miserable.\n",
      "its really unfortunate i really was interested in playing the game but i only put one star because i wasnt able to get it to play. i downloaded it on my lenovo chromebook with lots of free space i practically emptied everything for this game regardless and yet it would load for literally hours but never start. i tried it three times i tried downloading it on a different device i tried using a different wifi source but it never works it just drains my battery. \n",
      "ive always wanted to play a game with high quality anime visuals and high degree of freedom. genshin is the closest. also this games rate of update that has lots of content is pretty much unprecedented in video game history.\n",
      "as soon as i got to know the new region of sumeru improvements of story telling methods could be felt within my veins and bones. the serenity has excelled the previous ones again and its gotten more complex. it makes me happy that i can witness these excitement again \n",
      "for sure one of the best games ever its super diverse so theres a ton of stuff you can do but it can be a bit overwhelming at first so make sure to follow all the tutorials in the game but otherwise its one of the best games ive ever played. defo rec for phones with 128gb and higher cuz this game takes up a lot of space \n",
      "its pretty good for awhile but it gets tedious and repetitive after a while. overall not bad but takes up to much storage for what i think is not engaging enough gameplay.\n",
      "i really love this game but the reason i rate it 4 stars because ive been playing it for a while now but ive been bumping into some problems because whenever i fight enemies i cant see theyre health bar when i attack them so its abit hard to defeat them without seeing theyre health so yeah thats all i really hope you fix this bug or something\n",
      "best rpg i have ever played. recommend to all. definitely worth all the hype about it. just wish there was character interactions such as when you speak to the girl in the library it should be different speech for each character.\n",
      "taking everything into account this game is... bad to say the least. i rarely see any reviews talking about how absolutely frustrating this game actually is. the graphics are stunning the new character releases are fun exploration is wonderful. the fighting is unbalanced the puzzles are awful and migraine inducing and dont make me mention when you actually mix them together. the lightning on the islands are horrible. makes a calm person rage quit like no tomorrow. please fix this game...\n",
      "considering this is a free game. what youre getting for free is phenomenal basically a very good breathe of the wild style clone. id highly recommend downloading on pc as well to take advantage of the cross save feature too.\n",
      "this is an amazing game with great lore and graphics. however the farming systems is horrible such as artifacts it is lack of many basic things that will bring no harm to developer but could greatly help the player such as skip buttons for story quest more end game events increasing condense capacity to 50 and create an rare item such as daily commission skip card so that busy people can play another time and make coop useful. character design is showing too much skin.\n",
      "this game is normally a 10 10 5 review quality game bc the open world is amazing combat is perfect character designs are good. but recently the game has been plagued by disgustingly incessant time consuming puzzles. its a sad way to create more content. your just wasting everyones time now and we are not willing to pay anymore bc of puzzles these need to be non mandatory. whoever is designing approving these needs to go work for a puzzle game not hoyoverse genshin. please do us a favor.\n",
      "game is awesome u dont have to spend money to have a fulfilling experience updates are thorough and consistent. always fix any issues immediately and always keep the consumer in the loop of whats going on if i couldve gave 10 stars i would have i just wish they would add controller support for android like they did for ios a long time ago\n",
      "hello im here to express my worries and compliments to the game. ive been obsessed with this game ever since i started playing it. characters are good story lines events etc. but i hope genshin could be quite flexible in low fps laptops or phones. as a mobile user its kind of hard to keep up with my co op team. both open world and specially when we do domains. mostly i use a healer but i cant stack up energy because of slow appearance of enemies. but overall my experience was super fun.\n",
      "i love this game. the music is top notch. the graphics are beautiful and the character designs have a different uniqueness to each of them. the fact that you can play with your friends online is what adds to the game. each main quest and side quest all have lore and are important to know more about the game. the game makes you want to keep going and learn more about the world of teyvat and the new imcoming continents.\n",
      "the best game ever the storyline the graphics the soundtracks everything about this game is so gorgeous and aesthetic i could literally play this game for hours overall a great game even on mobile though i would reccomend you to have a pretty good quality phone as this takes a lot of storage and also is laggy sometimes but the overall reating would be 4.5 5\n",
      "the reason this game is getting a 1 star review is the account management. i spent 3 hours trying to login to my ps5. there is nowhere to login. you have to make a new account. so i made one hoping i could switch accounts. nope cant do it. i login to the new account on a pc and it says unlink on the console. but you cant and i cant delete the new account for 30 days what a piece of garbage.\n",
      "while genshin is a good game its wish pity system is infuriating. i play for hours on end and grind for primos and even buy primos out of desperate attempt to get characters i want only to get hundreds of trash weapons i will never use. the only times i have gotten anything good is when i stop playing for months and when i get back i get sometuing rare. at the very least it would be nice to get more primos from missions and commissions. i would honestly not recommend.\n",
      "gonna switch to tower of fantasy even i spent thousands of dollars here. genshin is getting so boring. multiplayer is dull and serenitea pot is a big mistake. you could have replace it with something interesting it consumed alot of memory special for mobile phone users but its too late some pl put a lot of effort in it but most of the players nah its just a waste i never touched mine.\n",
      "high production values meaning good graphics animation music but awfully terrible game design. too much unnecessary rng frustrating experience everywhere no customer feedback no improvements to gameplay in years no repeatable content chorey. boring eye ear candy.\n",
      "very good game gameplay story graphics perfect i just think the characters arent as cool as the ones in honkai impact. they lack a bit of eccentricity in them. haha and it lacks skins.\n",
      "after playing for almost 2 years logging in the game starts to be a bother to me i only won 2 50 50s since launch and i cant count how many times ive lost i feel like ive been scammed im just waiting for the 2nd anniversary to make me feel disappointed completely and finally drop the game.\n",
      "this game is so fun with good story line and i can do various things in game. and it will be much more interesting if they make the chest reset every week or two so that every player wont get tired exploring i think doing that will make much player hook up ...\n",
      "i love this game but took a couple week hiatus and im having to restart the whole thing im not to sure if there was a mess up but i logged in with the account info from when i started and it brought me right to the beginning. its asking me to rechose a character and all. im not sure if there is a salution to this but i worked hard on my profile and would love to have it back. if any info please let me know.\n",
      "hello i love this game to heart but i hope the update on fixing the technical errors for not seeing damage text ice and grass could be fixed for some mobile devices its not much of a win to be able to have the storage to install this app w o even seeing the following stuff. hope this could be taken to consideration amazing game likewise it just could do a little better for us who dont have high end devices \n",
      "my game crash unexpectantly with the recent update also my world is bug or something... the world would load in time whenever i fast travel so i would clipped into the ground and fall to my death. pretty frustrated in some situations but everything else are fine.\n",
      "i bought a new phone before the sumeru update released it actually runs pretty well until the current patch got realeased. its basically unplayable at this point cuz i kept getting fps drops and it lags so hard. it almost kicked me out of the game becuz of it pls fix this even with the lowest settings in the game... my device is realme gt master edition and the processor is qualcomm snapdragon 778g octa core and the ram is 8gb 5gb ram thank you\n",
      "it wont let me play i registered with my email and did a verification code and created a password just as it said but then when i try to do the log in it always says account or password error . i clicked on the forgot password option and tried a bunch of passwords but it doesnt let me access either way... untill you fix this i wont give a better rating... how can i if it wont let me play \n",
      "this game fixes such unnecessary bugs but still cant fix their big map issue i been playing multiple different games with really big maps and world but none of them take as much storage as genshin impact if you really want more players to play i would recommend fixing so more people could and would play thanks \n",
      "i love this game and have been playing since the start but the amount of space that this game is taking up is starting to get ridiculous. just on mobile its taking up 20 gb and on ps4 each uptade takes around maybe 15 20 gb. it doesnt sound like much but it builds up and if you have other games too then youre gonna run out of space soon. like...if this game just keeps adding so many gbs every uptade is there even going to be a device that has enough storage to play it \n",
      "in my opinion genshin is the best game to ever exist and there is so many stuff to do at first but at around adventure rank 45 60 it get a tiny bit boring to do as there is hardly anything to do other than farming wishing and daily commissions. other than than its an amazing game and despite what i stated right now it actually does take quite a long time to reach that level. p.s pls make the skin tone darker for summeru it will also make the game more enjoyable and will help with sales \n",
      "ok i absolutely love this game yet there still if a few minor issues. the main one for me would be that since i play on mobile it may be like this for everything but when fighting the screen like moved so i cant see what im doing and i have to put it back the other problem would be that for mobile only i think it keeps lagging and crashing and yes i do know nearly every mobile player has this issue and the storage but for the storage i think its worth it this game is amazing d\n",
      "i played this game for first time recently and i am already in love with it ...i love games that have a stroyline and quests and mysterious magical powers and i have played a lot of them on pc and i am really impressed that a phone game can handle a game that has pc game like features graphics storline etc...great work developer team of genshin impact \n",
      "its a really good game and it has a amazing story the only things i wish changed is that it take a lot of storage and if your a mobile player it take a long time to load. i also wish that they came out with more 4 star characters rather than 5 star cause theres about 50 characters and most are 5 . when your f2p its extremely difficult to get the characters you want if it was easier to get a character like lower the amount of wishes you have to make to get a 5 it would make the game more fun\n",
      "i have been playing genshin impact since the first day they released. and had fun and enjoyed. but now its really dissapointed playing after new updated and version released. so much lagging even my connection is strong enough to play. now i am trying to play with every graphic low quality and until now its lagging alot on my phone. its really extermely suck to play now. i cant enjoy beautiful graphic environmental game.you should fix this problem and consider for player.\n",
      "its so good the graphics the story the character designs the music everything is perfect the only prob is that it needs kinda a high end device to run smoothly. welp its not a prob the devs can take care of but still.\n",
      "its a fun accessible gorgeous little game with so much opportunity to wander and explore. anyone feeling stuck by all this staying at home genshin is a free to play outlet with scenery so beautiful that i keep having to stop for a moment and just enjoy marveling at it. thank you for giving me a cute f2p outlet. also i have to say i adore the female twin shes so sassy yet earnest and i even love her companion paimon theyre an adorable duo.\n",
      "damn bro the graphics story characters this game is just amazing. the only problem is that its quite a demanding game so if you want to enjoy this game getting a flagship phone with a snapdragon 800 series is a good choice .\n",
      "this game is very in depth and well made. unique in its play style. the graphics are beautiful and comparable to console graphics. when compared to other similar mmorpg for mobile the others cant really hold a flame to genshin impacts quality. it is a every large download but not for nothing. this plays like a console game. better than anything else ive found so far. keep up the good work \n",
      "new update today 11 11. i always loved this game but always found weird that using elemental skills from my characters to fight would also cause damage to them. it never made sense but ok it was a damage that they could take and survive. now they have updated that and the damage now is way worse thats just stupid and makes no sense ill have to avoid using electric on water to avoid getting killed by myself whats the sense on that thats precisely when we need those skills and now...\n",
      "im beyond disappointed i have had such great moments playing this game but you guys keep missing the mark. you couldnt give candace kandake the right skin colour but decided to whitewash her instead. on top of that im getting really tired of playing the artifact drop rate is so bad and you do it purposely i could spend months trying to get the right artifacts for a character. i love this game but im getting so sick and tired at this point. my last review said i love you guys shame.\n",
      "its an amazing game everything is amazing the sheer quality blows any and evey competitors out of the the water the water effect is looks amazing as well as the rocks the sky and the mud the houses are detailed as hell and the cities and regions together with trees mountains look amazing the charachters look amazing and the gameplay experience is amazing as well as the amount of fun quests in the game but getting 5 star characters as a f2p is a bit hard and getting good artifacts is hard\n",
      "camera view is too up close to the character that it doesnt show enough of the surroundings and during fights that are close to objects wall tall grass the cam goes nuts and i cant see what the hell i am doing. fighting on hills the cam goes completely horizontal so i spend half the time readjusting the angle. tried to send in game feedback and couldnt not send anything. can you please fix the view angle \n",
      "i love genshin but to see the lack of representation and care of culture with sumeru is incredibly disappointing. with a vast and beautiful game world there should be a variety of skin tones other than tan and white. they have so much potential but they arent taking the opportunity to showcase it. especially with the new drip marketing for candace.\n",
      "this game was a 5 star in the beginning with all the beautiful scenery deep story and top music. but a couple of months in and it started to feel frustrating for a number of issues unrewarding chores and the companys tendency to cater to the male players overwhelming amount of timed events for newer players and underwhelming endgame content for vets etc.\n",
      "i love this game the character animations are amazing the bg music is great the scenery is also goregus the only thing k dont like about the game is that new players cant get the old quests if anything it should be they can do the quest but not get the rewards of primogems. other than that fantastic app keep up the good work also thanks for adding sumeru to 3.0 vant wakt for dendro \n",
      "its a great open world game with stunning graphics and easy mechanics. the only problem is farming and spiral abyss. farming will costs you a lot of time since it limited by resin and if you are in end game you dont have a lot of fragile resin left. as for spiral abyss as long as you got a 2 well build dps on both team should be able to smash floor 11 3. farming artifacts is pain rng never changed and they will never make artifact farming better.\n",
      "nice game could greatly use some optimization and fair prices on in app purchases. also lessening the pity system would be great too so you know it could be more user friendly and new gamer friendly. edit the games pity system sucks by a rating of 2 10 as there are lucky accounts. i have only 5 characters that are 5 stars despute my friends having 9 or more 5 stars on their roster. the pity system or the rng needs to be fixed. false advertisement of the high probability on banners.\n",
      "a great game and started playing since 1.0 however playing genshin now feels like a chore. the anniversary rewards are disappointing. most of the content are tedious and the amount time spent is not well compensated. there are games out there that give better and more generous rewards.\n",
      "hi i hope that you will fix the no damage bug since there is no damage that is shown when i attack. i hope you will support phone operating system so that we can see the damage that being dealt. thank you.\n",
      "this is the only game that ill probable play for 20 years if it continues that long... i absolutely adore this game... im mainly interested in the lore and the characters... this game is so detailed that even every npc have their own story to tell... i absolutely love this game... but the one thing that this game lacks is end game contents... when you reach high ar there is nothing much to do than farming and waiting for stories...\n",
      "in my point of view the game is awesome but there is a problem the problem is at the start then you first open the game since i had bad wi fi it took me 3 day to actually get into the game and what im trying to say is please think about the people who have bad wi fi and make the loading screen a bit shorter please \n",
      "literally the best game ever. i would love to spend my time for years just to see the end of its story. must be interesting when hoyoverse make us to create a theory for every story no. every detail in the games. i love to see everyone theory about how genshin will end or how complicated some clan or why ventis statue had gate to celestia on the bottom of it.\n",
      "the games been too friendly with me so far been pulling 5 star characters here and there storyline is good and interesting as well the gacaha system is not bad at all although it can be quite frustrating at times when levelling up your desired characters the games free roam adventure vive really sets me off to play it even more and more the graphics and fps are also super smooth that its almost like playing in heaven good job hoyoverse \n",
      "im writing this review on my computer but anyways genshin impact is an amazing game its multiplayer theres a ton of different characters and overall an amazing game but it takes up a bunch of space it takes a long time to get priogems used to get characters and weapons and it takes a while to level up to get to use multiplayer. but still it is an amazing game and id recommend\n",
      "as ive been playing this game for a year absolute best experience for me i could say im addicted. but as time goes on things gets what they werent used to be. but that still doesnt stop me from having fun with the new update and i rate this a 4 as it over heats my phone but its not really a problem for i only play 2 3 hours and the solution is just to be in a cold place but overall 4.8 if i could 0.2 points for not giving me heizou yet\n",
      "the game is phenomenal. so much to do and so much to look at. the story is so good and the characters are all so lovely and interesting. the only bad thing is that it takes up a lotta storage so be wary of your space. also the gacha system can get infuriating and addicting so thats something to watch out for. overall 5 5 stars. cannot recommend enough\n",
      "normally the game is pretty good however whenever i fight against childe or any fight with a cutscene the screen darkens and doesnt allow me to continue the fight or quit out of it. wastes a lot of time and effort when you reach the last part and it doesnt even let me finish the end.\n",
      "its amazing. i do have a problem but still it deserves 5 stars. i place in a samsung tablet and it was working fine until i got to springvale to defeat enemies and rank up but unlucky it started to glitch alot. only bare color screens were there. pls fix it and when i close the app music is glitching pls fix but iverall geart game love it\n",
      "add skip button please. like the amount of dialogue you have to go through is mind boggling. oh you want to do the event for a bit because you dont have a lot of spare time dont want to spend too much time playing too bad have this 30 mins unskippable dialogue about random stuff but dont worry youll also get hours of unskippable dialogue throughout the event oh you are a new player well too bad have this 50 hr unskippable dialogue before you can go to a new area and do the event \n",
      "wont even let me login without giving me the insufficient storage space pop up. i have 50 gb left on my device so this is absolutely ridiculous. game graphics are good but keeps crashing and downloading unnecessary things into my phone to the point that i have to delete everything thsts in my device apps pictures etc. fix this \n",
      "honestly i love this game. the graphics are always on point and the story line is neverending so you can play for a long time without getting bored. although i would like a few more ways of getting the fates. like maybe a weekly gift or something.\n",
      "mihoyo your updating system has a problem. i pre installed for the game a day ago and when i updated it it suddenly restarted and downloaded 7gb. after that i left it unattended to update when i came back it decided to download 37gb instead. there is something wrong with the game so you better fix it. i dont know what i did wrong but there is a problem with it.\n",
      "it has been over an hour since maintenance has finished and my game has crashed 12 times the minute the u get into the game. it doesnt help reading all the horror stories with the lack of communication between players and the company so im not even sure if this issue will get fixed. i hope it does cuz im too obsessed with this game to quit.\n",
      "the graphics are absolutely amazing but i will have to give it a 4 because of the co op experience and limited time events. for newer players missing out some of those limited time events will ruin some players experience of the game because well simply they werent just there to experience firsthand. now the co op experience its very limited to what we can do like only allow co op within your chosen server which is disappointing because not everyone in one server speak the same language\n",
      "i can tell by the starting screen the game is good but there is a few problems. 1. it takes forever for it to load i hate it. but i can tell its a good game when you dont have this problem 2. it says my files are not there i have played on a different device and it works fine there. please fix this \n",
      "its an incredible game with a good story line and character lineup but it requires so much space. it also will overheat on mobile so much so that it literally burns my hands. yes even if it fulfills the requirements . the download for the game is also ridiculously big. hoping for improvements on that especially considering other big mobile games dont do the same.\n",
      "there is a bug in the new golden apple archipelago event in fischls mirage where when you have to find the missing pieces of the castle when i fell through a glitch after i revived when i got back to the tower it had already rotated and there was no stretch of pathway to walk to the tower. effectively i cannot finish the domain. please fix this \n",
      "except for the system where you can just pay to wish for any character you want even though getting 5 stars as a f2p player is hard i think its a nice challenge. the exploration is the real fun part of the game and the storyline is also interesting so overall i would recommend it.\n",
      "update broke my game. repairing did nothing. stuck on black screen after entering. soundtrack still plays and it shows iud at the bottom right update had to reinstall the whole game. huge pain. ill keep the rating because the amount of things you have to grind for have become unreasonable. its a chore now instead of a fun game\n",
      "its an amazing game. everything is just amazing. character design lore even the small details. but theres two problems the amount of data you save from really old events that just take up probably 2 3 gb. and the fact all sumeru characters are white. bruh. if natlan is all white i will be uninstalling. if this was fixed it would be 5 stars.\n",
      "the graphics in this game are amazing beautiful character designs and amazing destinations i personally love the archon quests the most and cant wait for more content have a nice day and dont forget to stay hydrated and eat \n",
      "amazing game graphics are controlable you dont have to do quests you can play with other people its amazing but the wishing system was really unfair to me.. i am ar 48 normally people would have about 3 4 five stars but i only got my first five star at ar 45 it has been really difficult to complete quests as because the five star is a support i am aware that its a system and not my luck but im hoping mihoyo sees this and resolves this problem but overall its a good game.\n",
      "so overall its a pretty good rpg game it has tons of characters i can choose from and an interesting story but it started to do this weird thing that results the game to crash multiple times im playing on mobile and this a very big issue since it sometimes interrupts my gameplay so i hope you can do something to fix but its a pretty good game though ive grown pretty attached to it\n",
      "this game is excellent the design of the characters are great and the gameplay easy to understand when you are beginner. i am currently playing this game for over a year now but i have no issue except for high storage to play and having red wifi bar when im in other world. overall this game is fun and excellent to try that i recommend for a new player.\n",
      "im still disappointed with the artifact stats and rolls make it so hard to build characters especially as someone ar55 which make me want to play the game for less time. the resin cap also doesnt help much when farming materials and artifacts for multiple characters unless you pay for the extra resin. i hope there will be some optimization because the game is making depressed and im getting tired of being hopeful that the game gets better.\n",
      "amazing graphics cool characters my fav is qiqi i really recommend this d but i bought allot of furniture and then tried to customize my serenitea pot but it said something like this function is undergoing maintiance please try later so i tried the next day and the next day and even today i cant customize it i hope it gets fixed i think its a glitch by the way i think the prices for primogems are a bit too high and yeah this game is amazing and has a great storyline d\n",
      "its a great game high graphics and really cool art style but the thing is a lot of bugs for mobile players especially the signora yun jin and dvalin texture bug. please fix these problems as soon as possible. overall the game is really fun and would really reccomend\n",
      "i love this game ive been play for months and theres a problem for some of a mobile player like we dont have a grass and we cant see any text damage and when we do the ice bridge on the water we cant see the ice and now after the update of the 2.8 i cant see the enemies hp.i hope you can fix this thing thank you i enjoy playing your game.\n",
      "i absolutely love this game. the style and work put into it is just amazing not to mention they literally have characters with amazing voice actors personalities and more i would like windtrace to be bought back tho as i wasnt here for it and i would love to play it with my friends. overall one of the best games ive ever played.\n",
      "definitely a great game. love the story and overall play of the game. may be a tad confusing with some stuff... but overall a cool game. would definitely recommend it to friends and anyone that likes story adventure and semi fighting games. thank you. \n",
      "this game is the best i like the graphics the characters the story everything. there is only one common problem the storage. i play this game on my tablet so problems with storage are kinda starting to bother me right now but if you have a better device pc or ps i highly recommend this amazing game.\n",
      "its amazing its a very good game and i like it so much i love how theres a lot of places to explore and different kinds of enemies although. i cant see gras and damage text so if possible to fix i would be glad d\n",
      "one of the best games ive played in while. also a bit too addictive for me have to take a break. needs a few tweaks but all good 9 10 . note for new players research all you can from youtube sevyplays is great but all in all have fun. play it to enjoy the game not to get every detail.\n",
      "the art is beautiful the character are well made and the music is top tier. the game is soothing to play but i wouldnt recommend grinding it. all of the quests have a very heart warming story line and im glad that i decided to play this. you may have a hard time catching up if you start now but if you dont take it seriously youll enjoy playing.\n",
      "absolutely love this game the graphics and everything is just a chefs kiss tho i think everyone would love a bit more resin. most of our luck is rlly bad and with new elements coming out the rates are going to drop which will make it harder to get the stuff we need other than that love it \n",
      "the game refuses to implement qol changes and it also refuses to fix bugs that were in the game from a long time. all in all the game is still pretty good. of course the game at the beginning will be amazing and youll find yourself playing for hours every single day. however your passion in thjs game would fizzle out tho it still keeps you motivated in playing it due to new maps characters stories and events.\n",
      "its a beautiful game with really nice lore and wonderful characters. theres a lot to do with even more things coming soon. the only downside i would say is if youre playing on mobile it will feel like youre phone is about to explode. you can still play it but id recommend console or pc. the download is long as hell but its pretty worth it. the gacha aspect is really addictive and its hard to not spend money on this game. its not for everyone but i still highly recommend it \n",
      "i played on console before. very beautiful game. however...i had to change from 5 to 3 stars. damage numbers. ice on water. grass. issues folks with low end to mid grade phones have and have been having for a while now. even integrity checks return files missing . click to repair. it restarts repairs it but run integrity check again. files still missing. whats missing i have a legit from google play copy. maybe what the issue is...idk. app is incomplete i guess...and falling on deaf ears.\n",
      "as time goes on theres less and less to do. theres no end game content besides events and even so they can be completed in under a few hours usually. if you spend your time to complete the story quests slowly i dont think itd b ethis boring but too bad for me since ive already finished most quests.\n",
      "the game is good. quests maps and combat is fun but endgame content is repetitive. endless grinding just for a new character you got gets boring after a few minutes. personally my opinion about the diversity in characters is pathetic only two dark skinned characters that are only 4 stars. the colorism and orientalism in this game is awful. its just pale and brown skin.\n",
      "this is probably the best game ive ever played i love how you have alot to do in the game and can never get bored playing it but it can get pretty overwhelming especially for new players based on what i experienced bcs you need to catch up on your quests but overall its a great game you really need to play it alot if you want to level or build your characters you also need to farm for your characters abd weapons and thats where it gets overwhelming especially if your busy like a student like me\n",
      "i absolutely love this game and have spent a lot of hours and days playing . premogems are a little taxed after the 1 top off and they are harder to earn for free after playing a while. but i still continued to play until about 3 weeks ago my saved data was gone and my account cannot be accessed. i have tried to contact customer service but havent heard anything back. i guess im going to have to stop playing because i am not starting over. i had almost all my 4 chrctrs c6 . 15 5 .\n",
      "its a great game though underrated the graphics are great just so that every one knows this game has a nuclear bomb waiting for you inside when you first open it you need to download an internal data of around 2364mb its a 15gb game. but its good its worth it my problem is when we unlock new story or archon missions their are certain characters you that shown up and we get a trial but we never get them like the beginning of the game like kaya so a request give a charecter afterevery10thmissn\n",
      "okay i have been playing genshin for quite a while and as it progressed it.got.worse. every update slowly but surely got more boring and took up more space. and one thing that really bugs me is this games horrible lack of diversity. its a game about multiculture yet lacks completely any other skintone than paper white.\n",
      "the default layout kinda sucks. we need layout customization. the gyro also has no sensitivity settings. resin system also takes a long time to fill. as a late game player theres nothing to do in this game other than daily com event and spend resin. we need more end game content. overall all good hopefully we can get better update in the future.\n",
      "game that can compete even with aaa titles on console or pc. have put 800 hours into it good quality free game experiences but the phone requirement is very high. very f2p friendly for those who just want to play the game maybe the most f2p friendly . high cost if you want to collect all units.\n",
      "i really like this game. but i do have a complain. i keep on crashing for no reason and the worst part it takes a really long time for the loading screen to load. im not sure if this only happens to me but if this happens to others too please fix it.\n",
      "thank you for creating such games like this one im glad i found this game character design maps quest stories cut scenes and all the simple details is mind blowing keep up the good work this game will always be my recommendation to everyone best game ever played so far \n",
      "finally i got the chance to play ive been waiting wanting to play this so bad i got an early access but i didnt have a good phone before. this was 2 years ago.. now i have a descent phone i can say it is worth the wait the game is beautiful i have not experienced a bug yet. the game now is so polished my experience so far is wonderful. thankyou for making this game possible. been playing for a week seems like i miss so much things from events in the past tvt\n",
      "overall i really like this game and i spend a lot of time playing it but sometimes it feels really annoying when a puzzle is excessively difficult and then i hardly get any reward and its overly difficult to gain characters. i frequently receive only 1 primogem from quests. which is highly annoying considering i need 1600 to do a 10 pull.\n",
      "performance isnt great on old hardware but getting phones that can run it isnt that expensive now. i play on highest but 60fps instead of 30 and yes i frame drop sometimes but its not always and my phone only costed 250 . the game is definitely not for people who want to grind without time limits and people who hate luck based systems but the plot graphics and gameplay gacha and waiting asides are any gamers dream edit they refuse to add controller support which is present on ios \n",
      "hello genshin impact i think i have found a bug or a glitch it is about dvalin and venti were you shoot dvalins weak spot the purple things once i finish that i cant move or pause i thought you had to die in order to finish it but it didnt work i cant even move an inch i cant click anything maybe bcs of the update but you had to fix bcs i had no other way of finishing it. thank you sorry i cant send a vid cause i dont know how if you want to see it i think you have to be rank 18 \n",
      "loved this game but once you finish content there isnt much to keep you coming back unless you like repetitive minigames. graphics and music are beautiful but ultimately gameplay ends up too repetitive by end game when necessary items are locked behind stamina resin regen. it took me months to finally quit the game and ignore the fomo caused by gacha systems. its a fun game but dont get trapped \n",
      "im going to be 100 honest this game is fun. the combat exploring and story is amazing i love everything about this game but the one thing thats stopping me from giving it five stars is farming for artifacts. i used 12 fragile resin which 720 resin and only got trash can you please fix artifact farming so its more consistent or you could fix the resin refill it takes roughly 21 hours to get 160 resin only to use that resin and get nothing beneficial for your character. fix farming\n",
      "this is a nice quality gacha game with plot and stunning character design wonderful music. but there are a lot of fundamental problems such as lack of content on high adventure rank. characters are beautiful but their price is way too high. you get a guarantee after pulling gacha 75 85 times but even that wont give you 100 for the character you desire. you will have to spend another 75 85 pulls. this is very expensive for a mobile game in my opinion.\n",
      "before getting to the other parts of map you battle and its fun then after you beat the first part to advance to the other parts of the map where you can travel by boat just gets repetitive and boring think im done playing but who knows maybe make it easier to grow stuff in the teapot i think it will take a couple months to complete all the tasks to do that takes to long to do stuff probably played almost a year to get some of the other parts of the map specifically the waverider.\n",
      "great game with new concepts events. for me the sad part is its just take some time to complete those events getting those good rewards . i couldnt even complete a single story or archon quest in last 1 month .but i do have strong in game characters . hey developers can you boost the 5 star item drop rate i only have 1 5 star item even after doing 400 wishes in wishes for me so i can get more good stuffs . thanks in advance.\n",
      "this game is amazing but i have a problem. i have invisible ice bridges and no text damage. dear mihoyo if you can get this fixed i thank you for doing it. but now no i cannot do ice bridging myself for now and my damage still remains unseen. so if youre a android mobile player i wish you luck and not needing to deal with this glitch that ruins the whole gameplay. but overall its a pretty nice game.\n",
      "i have been playing this game on and off for a while now. while i mainly play on pc this is one of the most fun games ive ever played. for once its not a game thats money based i havent spent a single penny and i have 10 characters and am at adventure level 40. not only is this game fun to play but the music and art are absolutely astonishing. the game is still growing and i cant wait to see more \n",
      "the amount of dialogue has become ridiculous and has made me loose complete interest in playing for more than a few minutes. add a skip function you already have auto and you can tap through just make it skip to the next multiple choice dialogue event. also stop with the single choice dialogue why have to choose it if its the only option \n",
      "genshin is fun and good but over this past few months ive been playing for almost 1 year the events are starting to get really hard esp the golden archipelago no matter how hard i try i jus couldnt comprehend the puzzles i also have low resolution so its hard to see the stars back then primos are so close to have.now we get to solve a really hard puzzle n i think its kinda a turn off like me a high ar already done exploration and dont spend money wit games we need primos from events.\n",
      "genshin is a beautiful game filled with amazing features and events. however when i am waiting for my game to load it just takes really long for like hours. and the game is just adding updates and taking more of my space. always doing that after a month. i would give this game a 5.\n",
      "absolutely love it even though the game is basically a gacha game because the game is full with great characters stories quest explorations lores and so on definitely recommend for the game experience but i dont recommend spending too much money on the game. all and all it is a very good game and very excited for the sumeru \n",
      "ive really enjoyed this game a lot i can appreciate how well it runs on my phone. though i do experience crashes with loading screens but it doesnt bother me too much since i usually end up back at the same spot. for now until this is fixed its going to be a solid 4.5 stars\n",
      "honestly the game is great but when i already made an acc and log my acc to another device it doesnt work. i put the pass and my email and when i had to put the same server but it made me restart the game. but i tried every servers and still wont work. its like failing to connect to servers pls fix this.\n",
      "the game is good at first but you will see the problem once you get on higher levels. the company is not listening to its community and the new characters are underwhelming. the new archon quest is rushed too. edit changed 1 to 3 character designs are dope but well see about their kit\n",
      "i would give this a 5 star but i really have this 3 problems whenever i play genshin first 1 is that i cant really see my damage i thought you had to turn it on in the settings but no it really isnt showing anywhere second 2 sometimes the health bar of some mobs that arent a boss isnt showing up and whenever its there it would just disappear when i use my burst or it would reappear when i use my burst and third 3 i cant see ice when im on water i just look like jesus walking onwater\n",
      "the gameplay is good a character only have 2 abilities exploring and having the characters is the best. dont have much of a content for end game tho will only have content when new region comes and events also many things here was based on luck should fix artifact farming its so hellish too rng its like i have to sell my soul to get what artifact i need. i love the characters tho specially those voice actors. not much happen on anniversary unlike others. sad\n",
      "totally recommend this game has outstanding graphics a great open world experience and interesting lore various playable characters to go with it all. i love this game though its hard not to stay up until 2 am playing it . . . the reason why i give this 4 stars however is that this game requires a lot of storage so i recommend using pc or a tablet. also getting primogems to wish as a f2p player is quite the grind . . .\n",
      "the game is great.i love the story plot the graphics especially the characters and i play like all the time but sometimes i really wished the game would have a feature show dmg text so for us potato phone players are able to see how much dmg we do like other phone users. overall i really live this game\n",
      "the game content is great. the gambling aspect will never be enjoyable to me. its also unnecessarily difficult to manage your account across platforms. genshin is impressive for a mobile game theres a lot of content and its not terribly heavy on grinding like some mmos. its fun to co op a little inconsistent with what is solo and what can be done together but eh. hoyoverse isnt great at listening to the fanbase outside china. they can also be a bit stingey with long term player reward\n",
      "this game is really amazing lots of fun places to discover and lots of monsters quest levels new characters and some friends to make. i love the game and recommend it for others who like roleplay and fantasy type games.\n",
      "i love the game its lore events etc and im really excited for how the full teyvat map turns out but for us end gamers please add something to keep us entertained like a little minigame that could give us 20 primos everyday that lasts forever for example fighting enemies . overrall i would love to hear about future updates for genshin \n",
      "this game is beautiful. the graphics the scenery especially the characters . this game is great as it is a great way to bond with family. however a lot of the games fans are creakheads. ive been hearing about threatening and insulting the characters voice actors because they dont like the character or even making fun of this game for not giving them the character they want in the wishing system. its a great game overall but the fantom needs to stop.\n",
      "i first rated this as 5 stars because its truly well made but i have new concerns. positives first the regions are beautiful and super fun to explore. the plot and lore are also super intricate and incredibly intriguing. however there is also a major lack in representation the in game regions are based on real places and cultures right so why are almost all the characters as pale as paper also it takes up so much space. it can be very hard to play on mobile because of this.\n",
      "absolutely love this game i wish there were more dendro characters sm. i love dendro i also wish it explained where to go during quests a little more and while in the chasm i have no idea where to go its v v confusing for me. otherwise this game is super fun and amazing gladly give it 5 stars also please try putting more poc representation in the characters i love kaeya and xinyan but theres only 2 theres should be an more \n",
      "although the game play is good and the graphics are beautifully done the inability to use controllers is a bummer and im probably going to play on another platform. its a pity though as this game would have occupied lots of down time when im out and about.\n",
      "amazing game very interesting story plot and also an amazing community. this game has so much lore and story while having a fun adventure. the characters and relationships between the characters are interesting. music is wonderful and the graphics are top notch. absolutely one of the best games i ever played.\n",
      "okay so i need butterflies to get potions but its so hard to do it in mobile because its slow plus i really think you need to create a device to catch butterflies easily especially for low ar players like me. its really hard to catch butterflies and fireflies in mobile.\n",
      "this game is nice but... its just one problem on the masanori its hard to beat in one minute. it took me so long to defeat it and im stuck at the third fight meanwhile cant co op with other player. i think ill try my best to defeat it but its wasting my time to defeat the masanori again and again. so i will give it four stars instead. and at least this game make my day getting 5 star characters co op with friends. but somethings the task was unable to co op with friends.thats all. \n",
      "alr. i think its about time i change this review it used to be 3 stars because of some resets to the game and everything but recently i decided to try the game again and i have been having a blast. the game is great and im always excited for more the only problem for me now is just the amount of space it takes... i mean seriously 14 gigabytes are alot but other than that its great\n",
      "huge game which has several updates each year and has tons of content to never be bored then has storytelling beautiful art and art styles and a huge world to explore the downside to all this is that you will need a pretty good phone but id say its worth it.\n",
      "great and amazing game plus absolutely no ads the graphics are very nice and the characters are spot on i just started playing today and love it already but the only thing is that when u first go into the game i had to wait a day for the data thing to load but still amazing game and with for a 10 star \n",
      "the graphics gameplay storyline quests characters is all very good. i would recommend this game but the only problem would be a little inflexibe gameplay in co op mode like we cant trade items or drop some items etc but rest everything is great\n",
      "the game is great although im suffering from issues like i cant see the ice bridge grass or even the damage text itself so hopefully you guys the devs can fix this bug i really like the game actually im not the only one who suffer from this issues other players do. so hopefully in the incoming update it will be fixed \n",
      "the games graphics are really good which makes the gaming experience cooler but what didnt like is when people come to our world in co op and just take our resources without asking. thus many reject other peoples co op request thinking that they will be stealing their resources.this spoils the fun of those players who want to play with others.if there is a setting that allows the players to choose whether others can take the resources from their world this problem may be solved. thank you \n",
      "doing better this go around in my opinion. been back off and on i tended to leave on bad updates which was basically all of them game still is geared towards pay to win progress but not as much now and noticeably more rewards my main issues were still are lack of progression due to levels so far that aspects seem to have changed but will update review upon playing a bit to actually see of thats true other issues is the phone overheating severely and i have an s22 which is hot already.\n",
      "my experiences were very good so far.the events r fun and the game itself is overall really fun i also made some friends.anyways since the latest update it seems that my quests doesnt progress if i dont exit the game like for example i did a world quest the same dialog would keep repeating if i dont exit the game reload again.i even tried verifying the file but it said it needed no repairs my wifi connection is gud so idk why it does this.it only started happening since the latest update\n",
      "the lore and the whole experience is just superb every character is well written. the modeling of the landscapes are also awesome. i just wish there is more content to do once you reach a higher level.\n",
      "this is probably the best mobile game on the market its even more cudos being that its free to play. it gets pretty deep and its kinda complicated at times but when you keep going you get the hang of it and it totally pays off. it takes alot of concepts from loz breath of the wild which is a great game and with the anime theme and deep character story development it makes for not only a great mobile game but a great game in general. if you like rpgs i would highly recommend genshin impact \n",
      "its pretty nice graphics i play it on my pc and on my mobile when im away from it or just want to lie on a bed cross cross play progression is really nice only down side on mobile was the new game cutscene froze 2x for me i could hear the sound bu the frame froze till the choice cutscene then froze again.\n",
      "its amazing and runs sooo smoothly i have absolutely no problems. as for the game it self it has really nice graphics and amazing development. i just wish it was finally available on the switch and controller compatible on smartphones\n",
      "i gave a review before regarding to the bugs to dvalin signora and yun jin and thanks to the previous update when the 2.7 came and it all fixed i can now finally play them well without any problems. overall the game is good they were satisfying and relaxing even though there were difficult times. keep on the good work hoyoverse.\n",
      "this game is interesting but there is one problem 1 i cant see any numbers at all i think some people also deal with this and its hard for me to see my damage hence i cant improve my character. 2 i cant see any ice hence i dont know where i need to go and when the ice bridge is gone i need to repeat the whole thing again n its annoying. thats all i hope your team can fix this thank you.\n",
      "the game is very fun but can you guys fix the damage text for not appearing in a low end device like mine. maybe put an option on settings to turn on off the damage text. thank you \n",
      "i can easily rate this game 5 star because its an awesome game. you must play it if you have a great device. so the thing i want to talk about is the traveller main character . in the current elements that the traveller can access the traveller isnt that powerful. since he she is the main character he she is one of the weakest character. so i request the creators to make the traveller more powerful in the upcoming elements he she can access\n",
      "i love this game but now theres a new problem. i am completely unable to play it. i check the file integrity and it says some files are missing or something. i go to fix it. it should be fine. no. i go in game. it either crashes on the loading screen or crashes shortly after i enter the game. i dont understand whats going on. i didnt see anything saying that theres a new update or anything. whats happening i even logged out of my account and deleted it and reinstalled to try and fix it.\n",
      "i love this game i have been playing it for nearly a year im on mobile yes it uses at least 20gb but i think its worth it the character designs the scenery its all beautiful. trying to get a certain 5 star even 4 star can be very annoying however it encourages you to spend money on the game and the amount of primogems currency used for the gacha system you get for the amount of money you spend i feel isnt enough. overall an incredibly good game \n",
      "i really want to like it but it keeps restarting from the opening cinematic. 07222 update been playing for almost a year now and i love the story so far and have obtained 3 desired 5 star characters. its a very stingy gacha although the welkin is a good deal and it sorely needs an in game pull counter please. players need to track it themselves for the guarantee so im hoping this gets considered.\n",
      "wonderful game very fun to explore and get lost in. on pc at least. controller support is needed for this game on android theres no reason it shouldnt be here as its on both pc ios and of course console. people have been asking forever so its not as if its a niche request whatever bs is keeping them from releasing it is unfair to the android player base.\n",
      "updated review for 2.8 onwards the game is great first off its impressive a 3d open world game runs well on mobile and continues to be optimised. the character design and the art of the game is what really sells it. once you get into the story youll be hooked with their also being massive potential for improving the story in the future. however i only gave 4 stars cause of glaring issues like standard 5 stars not being guaranteed thus me not having 1 mona after playing since launch.\n",
      "now that i have reached inazuma it has been crashing wayy too often. it doesnt lag really but just randomly crashes and i cant play for more then 20 mins without one happening even on the lowest graphics. its sad really. only chance i have of enjoying playing now is waiting for the switch version.\n",
      "ive seen amazing ads videos and other things about this game. being highly intressed i decided to download it. however everytime i open the game up all i get is a black screen. i truly do want to play and experience the game myself but it isnt letting me do what i intended to do. if there is a way to get pass the black screen please inform me \n",
      "still no controller support years later despite it being available on every other platform the game exists on ios pc and console . they either have seriously lazy devs or sold out to apple at the cost of comfortable controls on android. i dont mind touch controls in games where you can remap the button locations. in games like cod mobile i prefer a claw hand position rather than a controller. however you cant remap the positions of the buttons in this game.\n",
      "hello i have been playing genshin impact for about 1 year now and i really enjoyed it. but i have a problem. i cant see any damage text ice bridge grass and the water glows too. im really thankful that you fixed the bugs on signora yun jin and dvalin. i really hope we could see the damage text ice bridge grass.\n",
      "character designs are ok. im begging you can you remove the goddamn timer in spiral abyss like it literally makes players so frustrated. and the devs just assume you can beat the first 3 floors in under 5 minutes get a hold of yourself. just remove the timer in spiral abyss it would make it much better.\n",
      "open world puzzle adventure team combat third person hack and slash that requires you to be both exploring its map and grinding domains for the perfect equipment for your character. good story tellers. it can feel grindy if you dont play with friends but the frequent updates and events keep us coming back. free to play players can be great too but needs good luck money for specific chars you want. edit after 2 years im still playing it daily and get excited for updates.\n",
      "greatest game ive played on android. maybe all time. one problem the installer takes forever to download resources and keeps trying to download over over even after ive downloaded the resources. any fixes please let me know. otherwise def. one of my favs. and worth the 30 35 dollars i spent so far.\n",
      "great game but whenever i play after a while my game pauses and says genshin impact isnt responding right now . and it gives me options on what i can do like close app wait send feedback .this has been happening for a while and it has been annoying. please check this issue if its just me then i dont know what i will do.\n",
      "alright ill be honest first of all the game is fun. lots of great things to do such as you can explore and complete the open world puzzle and get a lot of primogems but the only thing i dislike about this game is building your character it so hard to get the right piece with a good substat for your character. ive been playing since 1.0 but still dont have a decent cryo goblet\n",
      "the games world is absolutely beautiful im an avid fps gamer as always but this game made me change my standards. even at endgame you just want to traverse the world thats how the devs put their effort to make the world and environment. but still i hope their generosity increases more as the time goes by. \n",
      "beautiful graphics great story line easy mechanics the game is very interesting and full of intriguing adventures apart from story there is a lot of gameppay and i would recommend you to play it however i have seen a lot of babies giving this masterpiece very little stars because.....they dont have enough space for it why does the game deserve a low rating if its a problem with your device and not the game we should be grateful a mobile version exist and is free after all play it\n",
      "i love this game so much already... fun pretty voiced beautifully animated lovely characters what else could i ask for coming back over a year later to say this game is by game standards not perfect but by gacha game standards is absolutely wonderful. has a ton of depth the characters are loveable the game is updated at a decent pace and it almost never disappoints. as long as you can handle rng youll love this game.\n",
      "mobile version is fine and cross save capabilities are great but the idea that ios has controller support and android doesnt is just ridiculous. and its been that way for a long time now. very disappointing.\n",
      "story is great with good lore. music is gorgeous awesome and immersive. design ui is good they improve it with main patches here and there use hoyolab app for best experience . char design is average has mainstream ish females with few male chars. three models only for both kid teen and young adult so i miss having older chars to play. on android works well and ui is good. my main issue is with plunges xiao user but theyre more responsive than ever and getting better.\n",
      "i really like this game its fun the graphics are amazing the music characters etc. but i have a problem with the lack of representation of brown dark skinned people in the game. if youre looking for a game that represents you well as a brown dark skinned person this is not it. out of the current 50 characters we have there is a whopping 2 brown dark skinned characters in the game right now i think that speaks for itself. i hope in the future therell be better representation for us. thx\n",
      "could you improve game controls for mobile we cant control character after any movement like i have hutao but its not easy to control after her charge attack. if we already press any button that cant work we have to press again. in this time gape all buff gone in trash kildly fix this like pc if we press any button it has to press all time after animation. waiting for your positive response.\n",
      "i really love this game not gonna lie but since im playing on mobile sometimes i keep pressing the wrong buttons especially when switching characters. i would recommend to add custom controls and make the character switching buttons fixed so that we dont mess up in battles\n",
      "honestly amazing. the events the characters the world everything is beautiful. crazy amount of storage and can drain your battery fast but its really good definitely recommend \n",
      "its been a year since i started playing this game. i wasnt on mmorpg at first but genshin impact made me realize it isnt bad as i thought. actually its very addictive and it has cool stories quests and so much more this game helped me relieve my stress and it has been my escape from the reality of life. exploring the vast places of this game made me realize that there is such a wonderful game in existence thank you for making us happy. i cant wait to see more of it in the future \n",
      "i love this game the characters along with their designs are amazing and the story is great the only thing i have a problem with is the fact that you have to be at a certain adventure rank to continue the story other than that though the game is great \n",
      "the gameplay overall is good. the only thing i dont like is when the game suddenly freeze for a few minutes.not hi just freeze even my phone will be lag and i have to either restart the game or the phone.\n",
      "a lot of the events dont focus on their combat and instead a lot of it is cut scenes and puzzles. also if you miss out on event weapons as of now youre locked out from obtaining them.\n",
      "the game is fun and i enjoy being able to play casually with my friends. since this is a gacha game please exercise discipline and self control when buying in game items.. just enjoy the game with the characters and items you get when you get it. the android version of the game though i feel is getting too big for a mobile game.. also i get frequent ping problems when playing even though my ping is ok when i play on other platforms.\n",
      "update 6 31 thanks will do and update as necessary. doesnt work. i would love to play this on my phone but no matter what i do i cant log in or even start a new game with signing up on new accounts. its really unfortunate because i love this game on ps5. is there any fix to this i have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times cleared caches for everything i can think of.\n",
      "love this game sm but i do have an issue that i hope could be fixed. when in co op most times the game wont let me send any msgs. like i could probably send a few and then it just completely stops showing my keyboard i play on phone btw but i would like if that were fixed if possible.\n",
      "this is a great game but has an unholy amount of time gated rng. the wishes to gain more characters and weapons is perfectly fine. but if you want to level gain materials to raise there levels. you need to use a limited resource and that not including artifacts. i get that you can by buy it with real cash but there are people who cant do that . i get that this is a free game and yall need money to allow the game to keep going but this is to much. i would say more but im limited to 500 lett\n",
      "this game has been so fun the lore is great and the play style is amazing. the only problem i have with this game is the events are so boring and complicated and the rewards are so low. it makes me lose interest in doing them.\n",
      "hello ive been playing genshin impact for almost 5 months i am not sure but its been a while and i must say it is a fun game but i have a problem when i do domains while in co op the enemies spawns very late it takes me for like 10 20 seconds or maybe 30 before it shows up i play in mobile and i am sure im not the only one who experience this tysm pls help me\n",
      "been playing for almost 2 years but the game has become very boring and infuriating now. theres still no other end game content other than the abyss. its become very repetitive too. the new archipelago became complicated last years gaa was so fun how come this year its 1 issue with this game tho is the lack of communication with its community.\n",
      "i personally love the game but most of the time i guess some sort of glitch occurs that prevents me from seeing enemies level and hp which makes it hard for me when it comes to battle so if youre able to fix it ill appreciate it ty \n",
      "i have been playing this game for a long time. what has kept me playing is the grind as i enjoy grinding but i will admit it feels like chores now. all the dialog is terrible. the best part is the characters. gameplay is repetitive and eventually the characters which is the most entertaining part of this game will become boring. i did enjoy the exploration to a degree. cant say this suggestion will make the entire game better but im certain that alot of people want a skip all dialog button.\n",
      "horrible customer service when reporting bugs in the software. ive been trying to get a quest glitch fixed and customer service first pretended to not know what the problem was and then said i needed to submit video evidence before they would even look into the glitch. no chest appeared at the end of a quest when the item is needed to continue. its been over 3 days of talking with them and it was never resolved. i also looked it up online and many people were having the same issue.\n",
      "of all your updates this new one is by far stressful. i just updated it and said i am missing files. i tried clearing storage and cache but still ended up with the same issue i dont even know if its my phone or the game itself has a problem. it keeps hanging up on the elements loading page everytime i try to start the game. like literally stucked on half the geo element symbol.\n",
      "a very nice app that you could go in a adventure and go anywhere you want just by playing i recommend it i love the stories so much and also the characters.. anyway there comes a time it gets kinda laggy and characters i use does glitch for other people. some of the quest is kinda hard too for me i go depressed just by it because if i havent finish the quest yet i couldnt go on co op. i get a lot of pity too some people gets 5 stars by 1x draw but i dont it does get boring too p but alr\n",
      "this game is amazing the graphics and animation are so smooth but i would like to recommend that you guys put a mic on the co op mode so that we can easily talk to our friends or strangers. i think it can help us to express ourselves even better \n",
      "the game is great i absolutely love the story and game play however i was attempting to complete the archon quests and now am blocked into a spot unable to teleport or use co op mode because the requirement is to defeat the opponents and the flowers are level 49. would like to be able to play co op and teleport to the waypoints leveling up the characters instead of being stick in one spot. would like this changed or will not recommend the game to anyone and delete the game due to the issue.\n",
      "i like this game so much. character design voice lines environment story everything on a next level. gameplay is also super easy fun and addictive. need improvements and optimizations like stable fps and reducing game size.\n",
      "cool game. the quality and the animation are really well made the storyline are absolutely amazing you could never tell whats going to happen next. the charaters are very well designed.\n",
      "i love the game. the lore the characters the music and the visuals. the main problems i have is some that people have been complaining for about a year now and mihoyo still hasnt done anything. rewards the primogems gotten from events is extremely small. im not looking to spend days or hours to get rewards and then only getting about 480 primogems considering one ten roll is 1600 primos. the resin cap has still not increased. not to mention the diversity is just pale characters.\n",
      "i downloaded genshin because it was very popular back then and i still enjoy playing it but sometimes i wish there were more content for ar 50 players im ar 55 so it does get boring every now and then. the pity system also stresses me out sometimes especially when i lose my 50 50 during a banner that i really want but have no way to earn more primogems. also because your pity resets so i can lose my 50 50 at hard pity and grind for hours again because my pitys back at 0. but its good \n",
      "the game has become repetitive. doing commissions daily is such a chore and tiring. theres nothing new with the characters the design are similar and so are the skills. theres not enough reason to continue playing the game once you reach the endgame youll just end up waiting for content to come and theyll make you wait for a long time. the game has become way too easy to finish there isnt any challenge anymore.\n",
      "so far so good. i like the game a lot but theres something i notice the character name heizou has a bug in using its elemental burst cause when i use its elemental burst the hp bar of the enemy vanish. you cant see its hp bar so you dont know how long it takes to kill the enemy cause you cant see its hp hope you fix this little bug. asap great open world i played so far keep it up \n",
      "very immersive game play with character development stories that leave you hooked. my team of people are like my family ive grown so close to them with all the game combat and each character storyline. i also appreciate that new banners are released on a frequent basis which keeps the game play fresh and exciting \n",
      "played the game for a long time. retiring once but returning and still have fun. i just came here to give suggestion 1. please add more than 4 party option slot preverably 10 since soo many characters are present already. 2. add option to quickly trade artifacts with another char. or create artifact preset that can be chosen quickly. 3. please steadily empower the mc. our mc deserve multiple element use.\n",
      "great game i would pay for this baby. the storyline is amazing and ive been play 2 months straight pretty much. this game has absorbed my life. only issue is the gacha system. the pull rates are horrible. especially with 5 stars. like if u want new characters better be able to dish out the cash.\n",
      "personally i think this game is amazing one of my favourite open world games. with amazing music graphics characters etc. i do have one complaint id love for the company developers to listen to its fanbase and consider being more generous with f2p players as genshins rewards system is very limited and not allowing players to fully enjoy the game. id also love more primogems from comissions.\n",
      "this game is really trying to make you use a lot of money and in the game it really shows. the game looks good and it has a good plot but it takes a lot of time to get primogems you mostly get 5 primogems for one quest and you need 160 primogems to be able to get one wish and 1600 primogems to get 10 wishes so its taking a lot of time and the side quests takes more time to finish so its really not worth it to just get 5 primogems.\n",
      "the game seems very fun but when i try to enter my username or password it said failed or error and i keep doing it with different users and passwords but it did not fix it it would have been a 5 or 4 if it had let me into the game i will keep the game installed and try to fix it but if it doesnt im probably going to delete it\n",
      "relies too much on the temporary experience and gamblers excitement for content. and forgets the fact that players are wanting to get stronger but they choose to not let the players get any real progress instead let them feel even more gamblers excitement. to the point the players get bored doing the same thing over and over and over and over again. artifacts is layered with rng characters are hard to get please do something about it.\n",
      "game is great and i highly recommend as a fun casual experience with a decent story and characters that you can get invested into however the developers do not seem to listen much to the community or at least they do not act on it. some issues have slowly been addressed but took a loud voice to get any attention but they seem to be getting better.\n",
      "game is great overall amazing story immaculate music huge exploration fun battle system and gameplay minigames especially for a free game but i dont recommend it for anyone who doesnt have self control on their money as the devs will defenitely take advantage of your bad spending habits. theyre great devs generally but theyre not saints so exercise caution if you decide to play this game.\n",
      "fantastic game overall graphics are incredible on a magnificent scale and the acting of the voice actors is overall so impactful and excellent and whats more the story line and allies and enemies that all come together is very satisfying and incredible out side the box like thinking so thank you for making such an incredible game where everyone can enjoy it\n",
      "i always have so much fun because of this game d usually i skip every story in other games and get bored easily but i never get bored with genshin impact 33 theres soooo many interesting stories and characters makes me to play genshin all day and pull many characters i love every details in the design the scenery is beatiful and the voice acting too played for more than 1 year now\n",
      "i love it all the characters are all well made and especially there past i personally think u should play genshin impact with friends aswell its fun i wish there are more co op events to play with friends but personally everything is fun my fav character is yelan her play style and her design is amazing im looking forward for the next few nations especially sumuru \n",
      " not worth playing if it doesnt support a bluetooth controller. if the game ever adds support for that then ill probably play it again and actually get to enjoy the game. i wrote this review 2 years ago and it still wont connect to my controller. i even looked up how to connect a controller and it still wont work. this game is a waste of space on mobile devices. youd be better off playing diablo. at least that game can detect a controller. \n",
      "an amazing game. well written story a wide variety of characters to play. youre able to play whomever you want and build them as you want. though there are some downsides end game play feels like a chore with little to nothing to do outside of that unless you have friends who play the game with you. aswell as with the release of sumeru just around the bend the lack of skin tone variety within the characters from sumeru beleived to he based around east asia .\n",
      "amazing how the scene and story are plot. it is really best rpg for epic story. im more excited for more upcoming map and story. even though battle is little for those who love action but i really love the play it story plot character are set amazing...\n",
      "the game is amazing. even though im a f2p player i can still enjoy pretty much the games context. problem though is the size storage. i mean my phone can still handle it but it increases it size every update.\n",
      "unless you hardly spend time on the game its a waiting game and a grinding game for no reason. wait for content grind for literally any sort of progress while being timegated and spending a minimum of half a year to get a shot at getting a character you like unless you get really lucky. if youre f2p you need to save for the limited time character reruns to get a 5 you want but depending on when you start saving you might just have to wait a year. how hard is it to add controller support \n",
      "ive been playing this game for almost 2 years now and not once have i ever thought of quitting the pulling system can get anoying at times but i overall like what you get out of it the characters are nicely designed and the story is captivating\n",
      "i think i am one of many people that fell in love with this game this past year. i love this community. the music voice actors the story characters ect. i am a bit disheartened that an entire company had to be called out by millions of dedicated players before actually even taking any steps on acknowledging that their 1st anniversary rewards were lackluster. i love this game. and dont intend on quiting it any time soon. the company has taken feedback and has made changes which is a rariety.\n",
      "genshin impact is a great open world and adventurous game to play and there is never a time you wont have something to keep you entertained i love this game and its not too laggy but i do have one problem not being able to change the gender of your traveller. i thought id be happy with my choice at the start but later on i started to want to change my choice to aether instead of lumine. please make this available in the near future cause i know lots of people who are wishing for this \n",
      "this game is overall amazing but there are a few things wrong. first it takes up a crazy amount of space. second it kicks me out alot and i can barely play it. it it truly is an amazing game but those things are a big problem.\n",
      "very nice experience for new players that have things to do. the game is almost 2 years old now and there still isnt any form of endgame activity. pretty much everything that is added to the game is removed after max. 6 weeks. the devs are on the spiteful side and completely disconnected from the playerbase and dont really give us free stuff ever. meanwhile you need to promote the game for them for maybe 2 pulls in the rare occasion where they give you free stuff . game for short term fun.\n",
      "it was good at first besides waiting 4 hours to actually start up the app but recently....i think i could be glitched but i dont know but im about to because when i wish i never get a new character or a good weapon and i spend all my nights staying up for hours just to wish once just to end up with a weapon i already have 20 of im gonna stop if i cant get a new character soon because my health is not good for this....like add a few more primo codes every month or week \n",
      "best story and visually stunning game i ever played....voice acting is just fabulous . this game around 14 gb size. but if you cost that amount of data. its 100 worth it. and this is free to play friendly . but you need some grinding.\n",
      "this is the best rpg i have ever played in most rpgs everything is automated we just simply watch but this game is very immersive the music the animation the story i like every single thing about this game.\n",
      "i really like this game honestly. i really just made this review for one thing the teapot. i understand some people cant load some stuff in there but some people can. and that is the creator of the teapot can load it. some people like me dont invite players and do co op so we find it really annoying that we cant put as much things we can. so maybe at least get rid of the load or increase the limit idk honestly i just find this really annoying as a teapot main who loves detail lol.\n",
      "genshin impact is a really fun game and its free with really good graphics also i like the characters very much.and the thing that its build of lores very interesting i cant wait till all the nations are out i know it takes a lot of time to create that wonderful game but am not really a pacient person . waiting for sumeru so exited \n",
      "it is such a nice exploration game but requires a wealthy amount of grinding too and this game mostly targets to people to pay for the gacha wishing system but even if we dont pay we are still able to wish and get the characters we want and spend wisely. the battle pass and welkin is very good for starters who wants to get a quick start and have more efficient time in grinding. highly reccommend but dont rush the game and enjoy the game however youd like.\n",
      "i love this game i am addicted ive been playing for a month or two and ive come across this world quest the millenial mountains and i cant seem to get the animation on the cup of commons after i defeated the bandits and yes ive been trying to do that for the past week anyways i hope you fix that bug \n",
      "its good but after youve done all the story quests and archon quests it gets a bit boring and in my opinion i really think the characters and npcs can be darker than they are especially if they spend so much time in the sun. cultural representation is nice but i think skin tone representation will do the game well. would give 5 stars but the lack of representation disappoints me\n",
      "i love this game the design that feels like youre in an anime the characters and the story is fantastic. the open world theme where you can explore everywhere is on of my favourite thing. now that there are even clothes for some characters is more awesome in my opinion. \n",
      "just graphics and details the game play is not balanced at all some bosses are ridiculously strong have super fast moves that do a ton of damage. no auto hp recovery system you have to consume items or go to statue of seven rewarding system is also pretty terrible overall graphics and the story are the only good things about this game\n",
      "its polished and while the game was built for micro transactions you can progress trough the story and content without paying. if youre an anime fan who likes open world rpgs you might want to give this game a try since its free.\n",
      "its great the only thing that confused me a lot is the fact that i was logged in and i played everyday. as normal as it seems the next day it told me to log in again. so i did it told me that my password was incorect but im sure that its correct knowing that i wrote it down on a piece of paper not to long ago please fix this bug i want all of my characters back \n",
      "there is some glitch in the game i want to recommend you guys that you need to remove the glitch and also please make the avatar interface more user friendly so that it would look good and also you need to do some optimization for the game. overall good \n",
      "good game but one year later still nothing about features requested from the month one changing domain line outs artifact pre sets better camera controls for both third person and bow aiming end game content is as dry as sahara. one star because it requires you to log in in the morning to keep the resin from overcapping by the evening when i can spend it.\n",
      "fun and beautiful game. graphics are amazing and the design is beautiful. however it takes up a lot of storage and runs slowly at times. also wish there would be more diversity in the game.\n",
      "theres a lot of games that i dislike but this isnt one of them. the music is great the graphics on mobile are amazing the character development is top tier. genshin impact also reminds me of flyff so theres a bit of nostalgia while playing. great game.\n",
      "hello. i am going to rate it a three stars for now because when you want to change servers is does not save. but if you go back to your old server it saves there. i cant play with my friend properly. please fix this someday.\n",
      "as a game its phenomenal however management needs improvement. here are some issues. the bp rewards is stingy compared to other games which is engaging and full of variety. farming grinding system is bad. all is based in rng. thousands of resins are wasted most artifacts are destroyed due to bad rolls. it aint worth the effort anymore since progress is locked on resin. wish and pity sometimes become excessively expensive. rewards for effort is luckluster making players feel badly catered...\n",
      "this game is really fun to play and the story line is awesome and i enjoy playing and the characters are highly detailed and very handsome and gorgeous i highly recommend this game but i hope on other phones they can see there damage because my phone cant see the numbers popping up on the screen so that kinda sucks maybe because my phone is a potato phone but im happy because they fixed the glitch on other bosses\n",
      "absolutely love this game. but i ahev several complaints a ps4 player here and i was checking out my battle pass when i miss clicked and spent all of my hard earned primogems. and i also find that the mobile version is super laggy on android.\n",
      "honestly this game literally overcomes almost all android based rpg mmorpg games. the graphics is mostly like anime but the details in this game are too high compared to other games. caracter designs animation and world details are impressively good.\n",
      "a wonderful game thats unbelievably free tho if you want cool characters your gonna go broke. the only real issue holding this gem back from perfection are the infuriating and exceedingly frequent freeze ups that require restarting the game.\n",
      "first time i played this long ago i felt the sense of adventure and curiosity. but now it feels like a chore grind grind grind and the most infuriating of all is the gacha pulls on character what an absolute garbage. beware if u play this for the first time you will eventually spiral into depression and addiction. im done playing this bloodsucking game greedy fks\n",
      "the best game everrrr.....love the pity system and the details are soooo good...nice events and decent rewards i dont know if ill ever uninstall this game.. ofcs the only problem is it takes a lot of storage space and yeahh i need to play this in laptop to avoid lagging and stuff but overall its srsly a game worth install \n",
      "hoyoverse needs to shrink genshin impacts file size for android users making it more accessible. the game doesnt run all that smoothly even on 4gb android phones and not everyone has the luxury to get a new phone all because of a game ya know. i love the game its a great game. but please think of a way. love the game and all yer work. keep it up guys. \n",
      "i am sure that this game is insane and the graphics quality is superb. this was the first game i ever tried in asus rog 5 phone and it works smoothly when i play this game with headphone the experience of game is just like enhance. i love this game so much . thanks for genshin impact team for providing next level game on phone.\n",
      "i never had a problem with this game before but ever since sumeru has been released my game would often crash. i didnt mind it at first but now when im logging in and trying to move around game just kicks me out. its not because of my device because as i said before ive never had a problem like that before. hoyoverse please try to fix this. i will delete some useless things from my phone but i doubt that will help me.\n",
      "while i mostly play this game on the pc version the mobile version is still really good and fun to play using the touch controls. im knocking off a star because like many other android users having controller support would be great\n",
      "like it its cool but for me its kind of hard to get primogems and other materials i just started so ill get there soon and also not to mention the fact that it takes up half of my storage on my phone when i tried downloading it on my laptop it didnt succeed because of the storage space.but the game is really interesting the story is interesting and amazing so no hate to that\n",
      "an amazing open world game with smooth graphics and easy gameplay. has an amazing storyline that makes you want to keep playing and its basic characters make it f2p friendly. have been playing since day1 \n",
      "this is one of the best games for mobile players who love open world games its uses the fight genre but the quest are amazing every single bit of this is great however the time for the expeditions are long and how many primos for a gacha are bugging me a little but its overall a great game\n",
      "so far the best gacha game ive played. this game has top tier graphics immersive gameplay and top tier waifus and husbandos. most of the players i interacted with in this game are actually friendly and nice. i really like the co op system. overall a very great game and u guys should give it a try. pvp would be a nice addition though \n",
      "i love the game away from the pay to play and u know that other games with same style gonna be released and doesnt have that annoying option but thats not the problem .. i changed it to a star cus i swear i could play this game with my dualshock but after i got phone update and the game update it doesnt recognize the controller any more only touchscreen option please fix and make support controller for android ...\n",
      "probably played about 20 hours back at launch but recently came back to see how the game has changed. for some reason my account is back to where it was at about 2 hours in so i dont have any of the characters or loot from the other 18 hours. plus even after claiming all the currency in my mailbox and redeeming every code i could find i still didnt have enough for even 1 single pull. absolutely unreal.\n",
      "i love genshin but after sumeru update its become unplayable i have a phone thats only a little over a year and a half old and even on lowest graphics and nothing else running in the background im getting content huge frame drops fix it and itll be rated 5 stars again until then i cant play this game.\n",
      "almost 2 years the game release and they barely make any progress to the game other than exploration and story. no end game content the money you spent so much felt useless. their profit all goes to other game and other unrelevent things. time for hoyoverse to be burried.\n",
      "why does my game keep crashin it only happends during archipelago quest where paimin wakes up the traveler. after their conversation or the paimons line look over there it just keeps crashing i tried to reinstall it and even system reboot my phone just so it will stop but it didnt ive been playing genshin on this exact phone for over a year now and this is the first time ive experienced it kindly fix this if there is a certain bug that is causing my game to crash. i own a 6gb ran cp.\n",
      "it has potential like a lot of potential but it feels like hoyoverse doesnt really care much about the community and what they want weve been complaining for a long time about things to change that will make the game better we want to see your game succeed thats all thats doesnt mean you should listen to small requests or ships just those dont really matter but stuff like characters literally being broken both in a good and a bad way xinyan is still not working and yoimia is underwhelming\n",
      "hoyoverse please notice this this visuals and gameplay is amazing and every character is likeable and interesting but there are so many negative sides of the game that i hope will improve my first statement is how genshin is such a daily game i dont always have the will play on it all the time and it takes months for me to create a big amount of primogems the gacha system i stupidly got addicted to trying to get klee and used 40 for her i lost so much of my actual money \n",
      "this is the best game in the whole entire world seriously no joke if you have good internet then youll definitely have a blast the powers the characters the experience the detail the excitement the quests everything is so amazing and i love how there was the character saying happy birthday to you on your birthday it made me so happy everything about this game is amazing if you download it trust me its so worth it im so glad i downloaded it the second i found it.\n",
      "i love this game really but lots of the english vas are so problematic. on top of that hoyo does nothing to listen to fans. we ask for little things like having darker skined characters but they dont listen. other than that i really like the characters and the gameplay.\n",
      "best rpg game ive ever played i like the lore and the characters. but please make some optimization for mobile players theres alot of bugs in mobile that needs fixing and its been a issue for so long now. please fix it so well enjoy our experience playing in mobile.\n",
      "id say the worst game ive ever played. this game throws so much bs at you and expects you to deal with it. i shouldnt have to change all my settings to enjoy a game. lots of lag makes my phone overheat. its also really hard to level up quickly because youll always be out of something and without a specific character its hell to find material. dont get me started with resin.\n",
      "this game is absolutely amazing i dont get why others make a fuss about not having enough from the last anniversary. like be happy they actually gave you a reward. its their choice to whatever they give us. but anyways the quality the gameplay storyline and lots more are so good like bravo i also like the fandom too lmao\n",
      "the game is so fun and enjoyable and hoping you add more characters and more updates but my only problem is the storage. i had to delete tons of apps just so the game could download which is really annoying to do. \n",
      "the game is great though i have a problem. when i use kaeya and try to freeze the water i cant see the ice. its very annoying because i dont know where the ice is plus i play genshin impact on my phone. i hope the developer is able to fix it. though like i said the game is very great.\n",
      "i really love this game their storyline graphics regions and their designs are all amazing even in mobile. they really put their all into not just gameplay and visuals but lore too. all that aside maybe storage space might be an issue for mobile but the sacrifice is worth it. until youve completed everything theres enough content to last. after all that is done though its just waiting.\n",
      "this game starts off really good but as you progress theres less and less things to do. also the gacha is absolute dog stuffing. overall great character design really good art and extrodinary music but the game is lacking content and its open world is dull and gets really boring really quickly.\n",
      "hi nice game indeed i appreciate the design and the work done for a so beautifull adventure to play. unfortunately i wont give my 5 stars to this project... why the sooo long downloading about 15go to get this game take me 3h why where are the settings for graphics sound etc... i didnt find them... more impacting the pleasure the controls not everyone playing on smartphone... how to play on computer with android no joypad control like in other android games. regards.\n",
      "if theres one thing i enjoy about this game is the amount of polish hoyoverse is doing to ensure a top notch and satisfying gaming experience. this allowed hoyoverse to set the bar when it comes to making quality mobile games. the gacha is a nice addition for those even more adventurous but not an entire necessity to progress. all in all genshin impact is a superb case study as to how quality storytelling and character development should be implemented at all times.\n",
      "this game is absolutley amazing it has an amazing story line and the graphics are out of this world the only thing that i would say is that it takes up alot of storage space. but other than that i would highy reccomend it.\n",
      "the story was amazing but its totally incomplete. you forced to grind because you like the game and characters but in the end why am i leveling them in the first place. surprisingly you really dont need to spend money.\n",
      "its almost 2 years and there is still no skip option for the dialogues. save for archon and character quests we should be able to skip dialogues in short events as well as daily commissions.\n",
      "i feel like it would be better to add an option to be able to transfer data from my eu account to na account instead of having to start over again. my friend wants to play na but refuses because she cant transfer her eu data over. i think itd be easier for account users and friends so that way we can stay in touch and play with the same data we had before. kind of sucks how we have to start over and to spend more money to get characters we already have on a different account.\n",
      "playing on a 2 year old cell and i still have a fantastic experience. i love the playstyle... graphics are gorgeous and overall its just fun to play. ar 58 here and lately ive been getting my enjoyment out of trying out different team comps.\n",
      "amazing arpg with nice graphics music animation and combat but the end game is dry in content and co op is shallow and boring . its one of my favorite games but i cant gives it 5 stars. hope you add an end game loop to play and more social content that is permanent not locked behind events.\n",
      "i played this game since it came out and love playing it. but the service is absolutely terrible. my account was hacked and hoyoverse customer support and global support are so incompetent. they take more than a week to respond with a bot message. i provided them with information like my first payment receipt registration date and devices other infos only i would know but they rejected me 9 times. they put up surveys for feedback but they only do that to look good and will never listen.\n",
      " pc version one of the greatest games on the current market which should become a standard for mobile and pc gaming alike it has its flaws but the animation work and visuals especially in cel shading anime style are far better and smoother than any big name developer out there.\n",
      "overall i really love this game. i used to play this on my old phone and honestly my experience there was better than now. my old phone would count as a gaming phone so obviously it would be better than now but playing this on my new phone is laggy and has a lot of graphics problems. mainly i cant see the amount of damage i deal and of course the game lags and the graphics get lower. im not sure if my wifis the problem but please fix this bug for players that have potato phones.\n",
      "it is such an amazing game amazing graphics amazing story just amazing i love it for me there almost no ads the only downside is the fact that it takes a while to full download but other than that such and amazing game i absolutely recommend \n",
      "genshin impact is soooo lit. like it is the best game there are so many cool adventures that await you when you first log in and the game gets new updates now and then. even though it takes a while to like boot up the game it is totally worth it. i definitely recommend this game. you can even play with your friends too course it only up to 4 players but still. im also trying to force my little cousin to download this game so me her her lil sis and our older cousin eman can play together \n",
      "the storyline is a 5 the end game is a 3 and the beginning is 10 however they whitewash charectars. the endgame is quite boring unless theres events but besides these things theres not much to dislike. the charectars are very well designed aswell.\n",
      "lack of diversity when it comes to skin color are you that scared to give your characters some color. aside from that awesome game the storyline character arc fighting. it does get a bit boring the right ar you are. ive stopped playing after the chasm was released cause there is no way im exploring that maze mess. do better but also good job also way too much storage. i could cook an egg on my phone cause of this game.\n",
      "got pretty addicted to this game cuz its very fun... theres a lot to explore and you can do so much stuff so far theres not a lot of bugs that ive encountered and if your device keeps overheating or just getting really hot i recommend playing while theres a electric fan fan in front of u or you could buy a phone cooler so that it doesnt heat up fast \n",
      "this game is wonderful. the graphics are beautiful the story and characters are well thought and the fighting system isnt to hard. i do hope more darker skinned characters are added in the future though \n",
      "the bosses and rewards in this game just get incrementally worse and more uninteresting with each update. with each new region added to the game more and more enemies and bosses simply ignore your damage and have 100x the health of the previous region. you the player however are capped at level 90 with your characters and level 20 with your artifacts. currently in the latest region to do the weekly boss it takes 30 to 40 mins to grind through their million health with damage reduction. enjoy.\n",
      "the game was good and all. beautiful graphics gameplay is good and was addicting. but at some point the game feels beomes a chore kill weekly boss spend your resin and complete the daily quest. well ... this chore is not rewarding so why do it at some point i cant even open genshin impact. why do the chores with so litttle reward. the game becomes exhausting.\n",
      "this game is great i love the characters backstory and the story so far . the only thing is if the npc could go into greater detail to explain the visions and other stuff like that that would be great \n",
      "this game is good it fries my battery life and turns my phone into a small electric hotplate but it starts with a good story and stunning visuals. gameplay is incredibly tuned to reward you with big numbers. it gives you enough f2p progress to fill the empty shell of your heart.\n",
      "such an amazing game. a very wide and open world and the graphics are absolutely beautiful. the wishing system is interesting but cool but if you want a lot of characters fast you most likely need to spend money. however it does take a lot of space currently 30 gb. i totally recommend this game tho since it has so much to offer the story is amazing and so are the characters. definitely one of the best adventure games ever. \n",
      "now i love this game so far as a new player but i got a new phone a few days ago and i am unable to log back into my actually account for some reason. and i did double check if all the details were indeed correct. i still have all my progress on pc but i would like to play on my phone just to pass time and log in rewards\n",
      "its been 2 week the game stuck suddenly when walking quest or domain.got nothing to do with device problems since my spec are exceed the required according from genshin impact web.pls fix this bug since i saw a lot of people experience the same thing.btw to those that have a same problem guys need to relog the game multiple times until it smooth.\n",
      "cool game and now i change my phone yeay totally great performance on low quality although phone easily heat but still able to play it. im totally like the character design and also story line. dont forget the time limited event totally enjoy to the most\n",
      "the game is great but its clearly not for older phones bur recently i havent been able to play i opened the game to login but it keeps on saying network error and after the file integrity verification thing it just said some files are missing i dont know how so i uninstall it again but it did nothing i still couldnt get in the game it doesnt even matter that i remember my pass because when i login using google and facebook it says network error i keep on unintalling it and download\n",
      "this game is fun graphic is very good too. everything is perfect. it just need easier way to get more primo. almost every quest only gave us 60primo and the quest took us hours to do. so i hope the reward will be higher next time.\n",
      "i love this game but i dont enjoy it as much as i used to because it seems artifacts rng seems to be biased towards def hp. i have tons of artifacts where all the great substats go to def or hp circlet or goblet. the resin system also very annoying at endgame because you simply cant play the game enough as it just takes just 10 mins to finish the days resins. i have bought bp pass blessings but i am never going to spend money on resins. hence i end up not playing the game as i used to\n",
      "do better with your customer service. i have been contacting them for hacked account form for weeks filling everything with all proofs that i am the owner sending receipts of all the purchases i have made in game yet it still says that it is insufficient information and you regrettablly cant retrieve it. so much for all those time put playing and caring for that account just for it to get hacked and sold to someone else. i trusted you too much.\n",
      "incredible game. lets u explore and fight and is something im very intrigued by. if u love adventure and fighting games or just getting new characters to join ur quest. this is the game. its also kid friendly id say. u can set u join modes to ask perm to join. or to not or do join. u can do so much in this game. and yet the game is still not finished its only just started.\n",
      "lately my game has been having problems on the screen it has a locked frame and only the locked part is moving while the game continues to run in the background i dont know why but it comes happening more often lately after 3.0\n",
      "the gameplay is actually very nice. but sometimes i need to trade my characters with another person on the app. if its possible i would like it if you add character or resource trading to other player.\n",
      "this is a good game but a problem went straight into my genshin gaming experience i will not take the blame on our internet bc i know its not the internet but when i click to begin i dont see the loading screen and give a notification instead that says connection failed and i got completely confused and im sure nessa will be upset and confused bc we havent play for almost a full week \n",
      "i hope i can give it a negative rating. why cant your game work on mid entry phone didnt you have a cloud version of genshin why cant we have that instead of making it exclusive in china. that cloud version even takes less storage on your phone. it frustrating on the side of people who cant afford pricey phones or computer. we also want to play but wont let us eventhough you can already address this problem via cloud version.\n",
      "i like the game a lot but there is quite a few problems with it. the gacha system is too expensive its hard to collect primogems every day just for a couple wishes without buying any. levelling up in adventure ranks is very difficult as well there are only so many things you can do day to collect experience the amount it all gives you is also really low. the third and final problem is just how big the game is ive had to delete so many other things just to be able to even download the game\n",
      "i downloaded it because i was intrigued by it and i kept hearing a lot from this game. however once i log in the game and it starts downloading it tells me theres not enough space. i deleted most of my apps pictures even songs the phone is almost like it came with nothing but google and such. is it only me or am i doing something wrong \n",
      "this is an amazing game i downloaded it for fun but then i got so invested in ut i couldnt stop. theres one problem though im at adventure rank 25 but i have exceeded the the amount of exp thoroughly but its still saying im ar 25 still. i will be happy to change my review to 5 star once this is fixed thank you.\n",
      "the game is good. a good game. unnecessarily long dialogue with no skip option. lack of communication with the community that plays the game. lack of diversity. the amount of white characters in the game is unacceptable. hoyoverse wonders why people leave awful reviews about diversity when their main goal is to reach globalization . the dark characters in the game are on the edge of being tanned. hoyoverse practically ignores their community. do better hoyoverse.\n",
      "what is this everyones getting hacked almost all of my friends and discord friends. is this your scheme to let us play again and spend more ong bro this is so cringe. we be playing tons of hours just to get hacked. my friends tried their best to get their accs back for almost a year now but no response. what a waste. we are so disappointed. hoyoverse isnt doing anything about it. i cant see even a single acc getting returned on one of my friends nor any on reddit.\n",
      "very fun and memorable game love playing next to honkai impact 3rd. however on a strong mobile android the fps and lag overlaps everything from even moving or hearing audio. it gets so severe that its aggravating to deal with while playing every time.\n",
      "i cant even play the game. i downloaded it and was so excited to see why so many people love it. but when i get to the final loading screen where it asks you to click the screen again the game crashes. ive tried logging out using the software verification and nothing works. its really disappointing.\n",
      "its got alot to do amzing graphics and an engaging plot. you have alot of options when it comes to getting characters and as long as you plan right it can be fully free to play.\n",
      "the game is good has a lot of detail for a game on mobile and the story is really good too. the one thing i absolutely cannot stand is the lack of controller support for android that you have on other platforms. even if we ask it time and time again you always avoid it. without the controller support other platforms have this version is inferior. yes i said that. controller support needs to be added immediately. i do not want to risk burning my hands playing this game.\n",
      "the only right tag is single play others like role playing casual and style is false. there is no character you role. the system decide not the user. casual no lvling up adv enemies getting stronger and you cant beat them casually. down lv world only one so useless. style no. cosmetic not available. no sunglasses hat etc . grossing my top grossing is card game so this info can be false. also this game is open world puzzle game not adventure. because 70 content is puzzle full of puz\n",
      "warning dangerous for anyone with a gambling addiction or addictive personality the gatcha gambling simulation system destroys an otherwise wonderful game. once you get to a higher level its almost impossible to earn what you want by grinding. it feels like all the developers care about is money. if this was changed the game would be perfect.\n",
      "i think the game is good. but i actually would appreciate it if the devs put on gifting system tho i understand that items are craftable. itll also give the game a new light for players. also its addictive at first but as i progress along i find the game lacking in so many ways and i got bored.\n",
      "gameplay overall is quite nice not much to complain about in that regard. the problem many most players have is the lack of diversity in characters. with most characters being paper white and skinny and the tan characters getting white washed in official art its tiring. i really enjoy this game and its characters but the lack of customer response is irritating. i can guarantee more people would play this game if there was more diversity within its character design.\n",
      "add the ability to lower the screen resolution from qhd to fullhd or even lower. i have to play on the phone at the lowest graphics settings with no more than 30 frames per second. and even so the game sometimes slows down a lot. its completely impossible to play. my phone is samsung a53 5g with exynos 1280. this is at the level of the recommended configuration written on your website snapdragon 845 kirin 810. the performance of my processor is at the same level\n",
      "the best game ever 5 stars contains a lot of aspects to play where it has wonderful stories for lovers of stories and adventures for lovers of exploration and fighting and challenges for lovers of action in addition to the elements and their relationship to the story and the land of tivat in general and a lot of prizes also for everything and there are a lot of wonderful things that were not i mention it but this is the game i like the most and i advise everyone to download it and try it .\n",
      "10 10. i simply love the game. yes i know about the gacha system trying to pull you in to get you to spend money i feel the pull i do but honestly its so well put together i dont care. and all thats considering i play for free and i am utterly horrible at building teams and fighting so i end up missing out on some things or on saving up on some game currency because of that. the story the scenery the characters... to me totally worth it.\n",
      "fun addicting and spectacular. the storyline is gripping the worlds beautiful and the enemies varied. the puzzles are awesome and they sometimes have unexpected solutions. the soundtrack is just enchanting. this is my favourite game ever. i just wish it was easier to get characters and that the resin system wasnt in place thats honestly the worst thing about the game in my opinion . however i still absolutely recommend you download it.\n",
      "its an amazing game both lore and gameplay wise. the action and combat in this game are really good although in mobile the graphics are a bit hard to control. aiming and shooting are really difficult and sometimes even simple things like activating a wind glider becomes a bit difficult. although if youre going for the story you should download this game if you want a smoother experience i would recommend a computer for better gameplay.\n",
      "in my opinion this is the best open world mobile game taking into account the graphics the storyline the visuals the character arcs and the smooth game play experience. mobile players will inevitably face some backlashes like lag heat up or game crash but from personal experience its not so bad that one cant play smoothly for 2 hours. moreover the in game experience is so lively and engaging and even if you dont spend money on the game its actually really fun.\n",
      "the game and story is fun and addicting but once youre done with all of the quests in the game theres basically nothing left to do its still good though the play style of each and every character is unique and the music choice is calm and relaxing its soothing to listen to i love it the map is massive and theres tons of chests to get. no problems in the game so far in my opinion pretty fun and addicting at the same time ill continue supporting this company in the future 3 \n",
      "the fact that this game is free just astonishes me. the graphics are awesome the story is very developed and detailed. im truly impressed by the amount of work that must have taken i cant wait for the sumeru update d the only problem i have is that the game sometimes crashes for no reason i have enough storage and graphics and all are all good and its also a bit difficult to get enough enhancement materials waiting for days until we can farm them etc... \n",
      "the characters are great and their abilities are useful. i like the fact that you can venture around by foot teleportation or by flying and see other areas. i found it easier to buy items and potions to help upgrade my weapons and characters without having to use real money to do so. the game quality is great and i have had no trouble hearing the voice characters. i also like the fact that i can test against some harder level enemys without being restricted.\n",
      "great game overall. great world building unique characters beautiful soundtracks and fair gameplay. i do have a problem with the rewards though i wish they would give more especially for people who dont spend money on this game. theres also a minor server lag sometimes but its ok for me. can fix it quickly anyway. also the game needs more events so many players dont get bored quick.\n",
      "its a good game to let time pass. good overall visual graphics. although one thing has been bugging me its the horrible system in the teapot. you can barely fill an island with furnitures due to that annoying limit. and the furnitures cant even be placed side by side with one another without clipping the game. a lot of things inside the teapot are quite frankly terrible. moreover some events annoyingly force you to complete quests because certain characters are involved in other quests.\n",
      "say what you want about the gacha system or the botw like aesthetic this game is well put together and has a deep running lore with beautifully crafted environments and unique characters. however after almost two years next to nothing has changed when it comes to character variety. still using the same bases they lack variety. please add new rigs and body types.\n",
      "genshin impact is a beautiful jewel of a game. from the graphics to the voice actors to the characters i fell in love with everything. many annoying buys were also fixed thank you which helped me enjoy the game even more. recommended to play.\n",
      "amazing game. extremely entertaining and constantly changing. beautiful scenery and solid characters. the only problem is the grind as you become an experienced player. putting in so much time and effort for almost minimal results when pulling for characters gets extremely tedious. the system definitely needs to change. otherwise i love it\n",
      "wonderful game. absolutely adore it i love the diversity of the characters and the whole story is extremely well thought out. it surprisingly works better on mobile than my laptop. however its not very new player friendly. everything keeps updating and theres becoming less and less reason for new people to start rewards are quite scarce also. if youre thinking of starting genshin or know anyone who is tell them to do it now before its too late and theyre left in the dust completely.\n",
      "super great very optimized even in low to medium graphics on lower end devices. the character designs are amazing and so flawless yes sometimes it glitches but its kinda ok. the ping is great it doesnt lag the whole game is fun. the story the quest just one thing to add maybe you could put how many wishes weve wished like example 40 80... so that we dont go to the history page where it is slow... overall the game is super and fun i would recognize.\n",
      "i absolutely love the game and its one of the best games i played so far.. though i really hope you can fix the bugs in some quest.. for instance i really have to redo some parts of storylines in order too make the npcs respawn.. or either i get stuck in domains while in co op even though my signal perfectly works in another gadget.. overall i really recommend genshin impact you can truly enjoy the game and interact with travellers \n",
      "its a fun game but i cant remember the story because im not able to progress. the adventure rank wont let you play story missions unless you go do arbitrary tasks for hours first. i have no idea whats happening in the story any more because of this so ill probably just stop playing all together.\n",
      "great game to play. i just st started and it is wonderful. the only problem is that it says network error even though i have wi fi and it works for the other games. if you could help with that it would be much appreciated.\n",
      "the game is fun but literally whats the point of doing so many things for a simple waypoint and 5 primos the game is fun but the rewards arent worth it. especially the fact where if youre damage is low and you need to do something that involves fighting youre basically screwed\n",
      "wouldnt recommend to other people. its just gambling but if you want a similar gaming experience just play breathe of the wild. storage is a problem and overall the story is messy unfulfilling. there is no more content for higher level players.\n",
      "interesting but it has a few bugs were when i complete my commission it doesnt give me my primogems but still says i complete it. it happens about ever 2 3 day so other than that its a pretty awesome game great story line and amazing characters d\n",
      "i love this game if youre a patient person who enjoys taking things slow this is the game i would 100 recommend the only reason im giving it 4 stars instead of 5 its because the gacha system compared to a f2p player is kind of problematic cause you cant get enough primos for a guaranteed character from one version and with the new double banner feature its getting harder and harder to get the 5 you want. plus weapon banner its even worse for f2p player.\n",
      "the game has a whole lot of content to go through and even then theres pretty much always room to improve your characters and do quests. the lore is also really awesome.\n",
      "gameplay bad u just folow waypoint to just read more text lore bad controls bad combat verymuch bad no skippable dialogs dialog options has no effect too many text 9 10 of the game doesnt have va animations are the same for everything adds too many useless stuff multiplayer has no use endgame is dry recycle content is fine but recycling and make it even more stale than before is bad . this game in summary sit on your chair and read dialogs for the whole game .\n",
      "great game beautiful graphics nice sounding voice actors and interesting story. though i would recommend adding an option to delete past archon quest dialogues since there arent alot of people who go to the adventures handbook to check the past dialogue. and even if they do they can just read the text theres no need to play the audio in game again so i suggest adding that option into the game so less players would drop the game because of its size.\n",
      "its a very nice game but the problem is that in each you can get something new from your mail but if you have made a new account and the version is over you cant seem to get item and that is quite sad because there are a lot items that can be very fun to play with but since i dont have it i cant really enjoy that much.\n",
      "its nice for a while when u have content but when u finish the content theres nothing to do also theres a lot of problems the community has with the game that the devs just choose to ignore oh and they keep ruining characters that some people have waited years for by ruining i mean completely changing their design and personality \n",
      "this game was a great play not too long ago it had great captivating graphics and the lore was interesting. the new update has made this game unplayable on my phone the graphics are quite bad the frame rate is below 20 and its constantly freezing or crashing. i cant move two steps without the game shutting down. great game if youre phone can handle all of the new data with each update.\n",
      "slow progression but good artwork amd graphics. good story though full of fillers. not enough events and character gain is way too slow. and the game requires a ton of space\n",
      "hello hoyovers lately i have been having problems to be able to log in from my phone i am a console player and lately i wanted to play from mobile i already tried all the ways to be able to log in and it sends me a verification error. i managed to get in from a friends phone but i cant with mine. is there a possible solution for this problem \n",
      "i am very enjoy playing this game. it is free to play and suprisingly amazing high graphics. i really love to exploring the game. it is still playable on low end devices like mine which only have 6gb ram. what i love about this game is you i can join other peoples world. so you can play with your friends family and even strangers. how cool is that \n",
      "the event is th worst fischls domain walkthrough guide maze 3 like ts not even the time its the annoyance and the lack of effective instructions in a chunk of these puzzles. along with major quality of life issues and even development issues bugs that make this patch so bad. each domain has taken me around an hour to clear. these puzzles dont require much brain juice. they require figuring out what stupid gimmic the developers messed up on. the photo puzzles in fischls world\n",
      "one of the best games at the moment for me. i play on mobile and was able to achieve ar55 in 3 months something i never was able to do on other consoles to be honest. cant wait for sumeru i cant stop playing this game. every talent weapon or character upgraded good artifact rolls make me continue play this game. i agree sometimes the resin cap might be an issue for free to play players and i hope mihoyo raises that because with new regions we will get stuck even harder.\n",
      "very funand interactive ive been playing for the past year and never got bored of it. its free to play friendly but it can get easy to spend money. the story line is amazing so as the characters and the events that happen every update \n",
      "theres a bug in heizous skill when you hold his skill to max stack after that it wont deal dmg and reset skill i dont if im the only one who experience that but it happen to me a lot of times now and its frustrating i wish you do something there thank you the game is good and story 33\n",
      "its a pretty good game with an engaging storyline and a vast open world. sure things do get a bit boring once youve finished exploring but new region releases like sumeru are what keep me going.\n",
      "the golden archipelago quests are too much. its not fun its stressful anyone can easily quit the game because of the unnecessarily hard puzzles and complicated to understand and explore domains. it consume too much time now i gotta charge my phone often because of this game.\n",
      "the game is quite fun to play and i love the graphics free roam etc. i was wondering if you could maybe add mounts and companions to the game if you dont i completely understand but if you did that would be great thank you for such a great game \n",
      "the game is pretty but the progress force you to spend money in the game for a quick progress. even for casting a wish to gain weapons and unlock new characters is way too difficult even for evolve the characters some accessories required are hard to find. worse part are the quest the difficulty makes the progress way too hard unless if you spend your money to makes the characters more stronger otherwise it is not possible to make progress \n",
      "its extremely fun at the start but take regular breaks if you want to keep playing as the game just throw everything at you which leads you to not knowing what to do. also theres not much to do at endgame so take your time with the story.\n",
      "i am literally in love with this game the graphics and everything are so beautiful but there is one downside when fighting the camera angle isnt the best sometimes the trees and grass gets in the way of you trying to see the fight and also not getting enough primogems but other then that its pretty good.\n",
      "i uninstall reinstall clear cache clear everything and still cant log on. account password error password is correct email is correct username correct i still cant log on. i can log on pc no issue there the app always issues. ill update stars when this issue is fixed. not my phone got plenty space and its last years model galaxy model. update my family member was able to log on her account on my phone but mine wont wonderful. she cant log on game on her phone either.\n",
      "i love this game to bits but recently ive encountered a problem the game lags a lot and my phone is nearly brand new motorola one fusion before the update i used to play with the highest graphics and had no problem but now i cant even play at the lowest settings .\n",
      "the game is very detailed and follows a story that is exciting. the gameplay is smooth and graphics are amazing. the game not only keeps you engaged at all times it keeps you thinking with challenging puzzles with great solutions. highly recommended for anyone thinking about downloading.\n",
      "great graphics but the story could be improved and there is no repeatable end game content other than framing artifacts which after a set point you dont need. the early and mod game are good tho.\n",
      "kinda stopped playing cause i couldnt make it past level 25 because the ascending mission i found too hard so maybe make the game easier because theres enough options for a real challenge and theres no real reason for it to be too hard that someone stops playing.\n",
      "overall this game is excellent. but there are still a problem and i hope you can fix it. the problem is my current device is samsung a12 whenever i want to play genshin there were no grass damage texts and freeze water animation. i really hope that you can fix this as soon as possible its pretty hard to enjoy the game with this problem.\n",
      "i love the gameplay but once you finish all the main quests the amount of things you can do just drops off a cliff. not to mention the blatant and offensive colourism that hoyo is showing towards paler complexions even while pulling inspiration from black cultures around the world. its disgusting honestly. and dont even get me started on the difficulty of getting characters you want if you decide to free to play f2p . i wouldnt spend money on this game or even start playing it. do better\n",
      "i like this game so much. graphics musics character design story quest events everything is perfect. i will recommend this game to my friends also.\n",
      "really nice game and graphics.it does take significant amount of time initially but later stages gets really slow and you actually need to wait for game update to play more. theres tons of stuff to explore but gets monotonous after some time.it was 1.5 month for me update how big this game is going to be its already more than 20 gb now and cache will be more. tired of this \n",
      "fun combat that feels fluid with detailed characters and environments. every piece of architecture and every detail on the characters has a purpose reflected in the lore. if you like plotlines that pull inspirations from mythological texts from different regions of the world. influences can be felt from chinese japanese and greek mythology as well as a heavy dose of gnosticism for good measure. there is more than this but theres a character limit. tldr good game with good world building\n",
      "game for whales and the very lucky. decided to try again after getting a high end tablet. unfortunately adding controller support is too costly and android users are the only ones stuck with trash touch screen controls.\n",
      "i love this game so much but come on its underwhelming to spend so much time in a game i really like and not get a single good reward for my efforts afterwards. it is not that difficult to give us generous rewards but mihoyo isnt doing so because they just care about making money. oh but let me tell you if you keep behaving this way towards your audience youll eventually lose fanbase and thatll hurt you. i still love the game thats why im giving 4 but you better care about us more\n",
      "i started playing genshin while being treated for breast cancer. my son introduced me to it it has been a great way for me to relax to take my mind off of the stress ive been under. im very impressed by this game ive never experienced a f2p game that drew me in so quickly even if it was pay to play this would be one of my favourites. it is truly an open world game that has so many places to see explore it also has a good fight system many events to play in. thanks mihoyo \n",
      "great ambient music and open world as well as the amount lore one can find in this game. love the fact that we now have access to 45fps. just wish there were separate sliders for ui sfx audio volume and ambient gameplay sfx audio volume.\n",
      "its really a undiscrible experience playing the game because of the puzzles the adventure and so much more its just incredible other players might experienced differently \n",
      "have loved this game and its immersive storyline ever since i was introduced to it by a sibling of mine. the characters are lovable and very unique. the use of elements are so diverse from other genres that i cant even begin to use words to describe. great work hoyoverse \n",
      "this was supposedly five stars but the ping is hella high. its like 175 ms is the normal ping. its always yellow tho im in the right server and my internet speed is doing just fine asia because im from southeast asia . ive also encountered a recent problem which is when i teleport to another waypoint. it doesnt load and the game crashes. i hope that youll fix this soon. please.\n",
      "seen the game reccomended online and was excited to download and play only to get through the tutorial and realise there is no controller support for android. yet another thing that prioritises ios users. uninstalling as i was only looking to play with controller. shame iphone users can but we cant\n",
      "amazing game idk what im life would be without. this game is personally think that we should have a faster resin and more acitvtys to do when your ar 45 and more things get boring cause theres no more quests and theirs really nothing to do if we could have a mini game from our events like hide n seek in co op that way we can kill some time but one big problem is storage their a lol of people who dont play on pc\n",
      "while it is a predatory gancha game with many mechanics designed to psychologically induce you to spend lots of money. the game itself is quite fun in of itself. if youre able to control the gambling urge where youre not recklessly spending money its a good fun game that can be enjoyed for many hours.\n",
      "so i bought battle pass when there were about 10 days left . and it didnt unlock for me . i assumed my transaction wasnt complete so i bought it again . and i checked my account and the money was deducted twice but no battle pass . i thought maybe it will unlock when it refresh next time when the pass resets but no . so ye i bought the pass twice and money was deducted and still i didnt get anything for it . so i hope i either get a refund or provide me what i should have gotten . thank you.\n",
      "im discouraged by the gambling aspect of this game. blatant money grab just like fifas fut packs. otherwise would have been a fun game to play. i know its f2p but its paid subscriptions and products only provide you with more game currency to gamble with. not provide a better experience. no incentive to spend money other than the usual allure of getting lucky and downward spiral of a gambling addiction.\n",
      "the storyline was good graphics and colors.. you need to wait such a long time just to download the whole files 16750.84 mb. but it is worth to wait i gave 4 stars cause sometimes it crashes while you are playing but overall im enjoying the game.\n",
      "i have been playing since 2 years now. easily the best game i have ever played. there are consistent 6 weekly updates. the story combat exploration all are super cool.\n",
      "amazing game i love it so much but everytime im fighting a boss or something it restarts its health when i go in the menu no matter what boss it is also i rlly wish we could change travelers keep up the good work \n",
      "i love this game for everything that it is i love how bright and colourful the game is the gameplay is simple but strategic elemental reactions are fun and the story is second to none. this game is my favourite thing to play and i can almost never get bored of the game as long as i have stuff to farm. although fhe only issue i have is with the artifacts in this game as it is so difficult to get a good artifact and when farming for specific artifacts i always get the artifacts i dont want.\n",
      "fantastic take on an open world rpg. you will notice that this game was built from the ground up and not like other cookie cutters out there. what appeals to me is that its your open world. so you wont see other players kill stealing camping bosses trolling or any of the other annoyances youd normally find in your typical mmo. you can still with other players in your world or theirs so it still has that teamwork element. i can go on but its better if you try it. you wont be disappointed.\n",
      "beautiful scenery and character design amazing plotline well crafted combat and exploration. my only complaint is that you cant pet the dogs cats in the cities. 10 10 game\n",
      "for a mobile game it is really good in terms of graphics gameplay and storytelling. it is not pay to win as there is no pvp and the free characters are usually enough to get by. you can also save up primogems from events and quests for rolls. however gacha rolls are too expensive to guarantee a character you want 500 here i wont recommend this game if you have bad self control or restraint when it comes to rolling for characters.\n",
      "i really love this game. ive been playing over a year and i think ill keep playing. this is a vast world to explore and will keep u busy everyday. story is way more good than everything. this is the world where im having a good time when im alone. thank you.\n",
      "this version of the game doesnt have controller support unlike on ios. before downloading 14gb please consider that youve made the wrong choice in ecosystems. at least thats how they make you feel by not updating the android version to work with controllers that are already widely supported.\n",
      "thanks so much hoyoverse for making this game i love it so much the lore is interesting the characters are amazing and the world is beautiful this is by far the best game ive played now you may be thinking if she likes it so much why not five stars why its not five stars is the artifact rng the chances of getting good stats on a artifact is too low. hoyoverse be a bit less heavy on the def please unless its with husk pieces where there should be def but not too much. still love it \n",
      "this game just gets worse and its not even worth playing anymore everything just gets boring quick since its so easy to and the worst part of this game is you do everything only for the people with money the f2p either have to use some money to actually get a chance or get nothing. after months of saving and trying to get characters as i go at the same time i got nothing good at all and for some stupid reason i went to wishing and it automatically did the 10 spin when i didnt even tap it...\n",
      "gameplay wise this is definitely a good game. but ive learned my lesson and im never gonna spend my money on this game again after losing all my 50 50 both weapon and character banners. like come on not winning in the character banner is acceptable but losing twice in the weapon banner just to get the signature weapon all in hard pity. i cant help but to get salty.\n",
      "its takes tomlong to get the primo gems needed to do a 10 summon and the game itself is basically a copy and paste of botw theres a difference between copying and inspired from. and this game has took way to much stuff from botw so like even one of the cutscenes is like a frame by frame copy of miphas cutscenes from botw\n",
      "i really liked the game at first but during the mission where we enter the dragon lair i teleported outside the area before entering the tower. now the game is not letting me go past the barrier even though it was taken down in the previous cutscene. so please fix this. i cant play the mission now and it doesnt allow co op too. please fix this bug\n",
      "i love the 360 but the quests are difficult but the characters are so cool and i love the new characters the game needs 5 stars its kinda like roblox and other 360 games but my sister came up to me and told me to download this but when i went into it i saw the whole sis and bro and i started playing it it was so cool and fun so realistic i did not know there were a lot of characters but i enjoyed it so that all i love about genshin impact\n",
      "and also its bit lagging so if u can fix this problem please cause when i log in everythings fine but then i have to wait an hour or a minute and it still wont download not the app the data or something if u can speed up the resources download that would be great and also if u could take away the black screen when u first join it it would be really nice\n",
      "hi i wanna make a request. this game shuts down in game audio while i recorded this gameplay using system audio but then it suddenly crashed on vivo v20. can you fix these for me if you do you get 2 more stars. i give you only 3 currently. update can you make controller support as well on android \n",
      "everything in this game is absolutely beautiful the characters scenery and the story is really good as well. as someone who likes to play games with a controller i would like it more if there was native compatibility for controllers in the games. its really unfair that only ios devices have the compatibility for controllers and keyboard and mouse.\n",
      "while i love this game on my ps5 playing this in my mobile is very tough. its hard to control my character in the open world when your trying to discover treasure chests. can you please make this game controller compatible. would make this gaming experience so much awesome when im on the go.\n",
      "i wish there were more poc characters coming out for sumeru especially candace. all of the redesigns where characters were darker fit more with their designs as well as where sumeru was based off. honestly if candace was the same shade as her inspiration i would spend my whole life savings to get her. i also wish it was easier for ftp players to get primogems. with more characters coming out reruns and double banners its not fair to ftp players\n",
      "the game is great and all but after a bit it takes too long to gain adventure ranks still and on that note as well when you release something for sale like clothes for characters you should really keep them up so that people have a chance of actually getting them instead of just removing it\n",
      "the customer service takes weeks to respond. they do not provide compensation for the lost log ins as well and most of the players here in our area had account or password error pop ups even though we typed in the correct credentials. i used to love this game but for a grossing popular game the customer service is just terrible.\n",
      "ive loved this game from the very beginning but the company needs to really improve their security. ive had my accounts hacked multiple times and emails sent just to retrieve them back. it takes weeks to months just for a reply from global costumer support. please make improvements in this. i suggest having a system in where each time our account details change we could be notified.\n",
      "dont get me wrong i love this game im ar 50 but like theres a huge lack of diversity within characters three nations and theres like 3 slightly tan characters and aslo i feel like the game could do like hints some of the quests are just super hard like finding items and stuff i just feel that people would have more fun if they could have an easier time doing world quests and story quests aslo it takes up like so much storage its like impossible tk have anything else on my phone\n",
      "really a great game. i liked it very much. i recommend you should try at least once. the graphics the art style the story the voice overs etc. are absolutely incredible. i am sure that you will gonna enjoy this game as well\n",
      "surprisingly improved i liked the chasm surface and underground a lot. the new gameplay and puzzle mechanics are challenging at the right level. not too tough yet not too easy especially the resonating geo constructs the stories are also shorter but better written. even though i was rushing my quests for primogems i still enjoyed the stories a lot usually id feel burnt out similar to the previous patches but not this time.\n",
      "climb fly explore cook read. dont like to explore use teleport. dont like to cook buy ready made. as i level up new fun challenges unlock. no extreme grinding required. detailed world. lots of lore. open world where you can walk out of your map if you want to. no hard puzzles so far. there was one where you could even ask for help if you needed it. quests can guide you to your start point if you choose so in the menu. you can run and animals will flee. or walk and bowhunt silently.\n",
      "great game infuriating and difficult to play on android with lack of controller support. please fix this. been reading forums and its a big issue. why does ios get this support and android dont makes no sense considering the phone market is basically those 2 operating systems. atleast make it so the newer samsungs running newer android software can play it..\n",
      "its a nice game but when i play it lags and after installing it takes download of 14gb and after few days it starts re downloading means 28gb storage and thats also fine for me i have alot of space but after re downloading the game starts finely but next time when i start the game. after hoyoverse logo a whitescreen appears i stood for several hours to see the genshin impact ingame logo but the whitescreen didnt move and even after reinstall it didnt worked. again 28gb and whitescreen\n",
      "even though ive completed the quests in inazuma fully it still doesnt show as completed and im unable to move to the next quests. ive triple checked the pre requisites and etc to see if fault is in my end. kindly look into this\n",
      "very nice single player rpg. f2p is doable with a slight challenge at the start. the important part is the process in building the characters. giving a 4 star review since artifact farming is truly hell. hopefully they do something about unwanted substats. id love to have a 1 substat reroll in the game.\n",
      "hello. i started the game last year and ive made a lot of progress but two months ago i had to uninstall the app from my phone now that i downloaded it again i cannot access my previous accounts. it doesnt accept my email id anymore and i have to play the game from beginning. i am very disappointed. adventure level 1 seriously i dont want to start from level 1 again do something.\n",
      "to me genshin is hands down the best game ive ever played. it has amazing animation music sfx and everything in general. the game is so complex it makes me wonder how long and how much money it took to build all of this. the stories are very interesting too. i thank hoyoverse for bringing this game. i will support you as much as i can and wait patiently with any problems there are. seeing how big the game is i understand if there are any problems. i hope others will too. again thank you \n",
      "this game is one of the best games ive played in a while. its consistent bringing updates and events frequently. although i was quite confused with the story in the beginning it truly does become really fleshed out and enjoyable. it has a gacha system with rates that are easy to guarantee with a little bit of time and the system of elements is fascinating too. overall a top notch game. i recommend playing on a pc ps4 unless you have a newer phone with more storage. good wifi is a must have\n",
      "the graphics and game are amazing but leveling characters and weapons are way to difficult. when u buy items to level up in shop u can only buy one. and from there its sold out at least restock everytime. having to fight every time is a pain especially if your low in rank ive deleted the game once and im gonna delete it again\n",
      "the game is really good i love the music graphics artworks and carachter design i have poco f1 and i installed rom in my phone and i play in mid graphics motion blur off and it does not lag the fps is around 52 60 yes it gets hotter and i dont have ac but my fan speed is good so i can control the heat its depend on where are you playing.\n",
      "great app and game but it have a problem sometimes when i play it it always out of the game by itself and when i see the dragon my screen start to glitch andd when there are some like a storyteller or storylines the voice starting to lagging so can you please fix it its not my phone problem actually so can you fix it \n",
      "i love the game but my enjoyment cuts my resin out its already hard to farm materials to use on your characters and it becomes harder when youre all out of resin specially when youre a f2p player i wish the devs would give the players unli resin without spending primogems so the enjoyment is just endless because of the resin system i sometimes wanna quit because of it and not to mention the domains costs lots of resins and bosses too.\n",
      "no sound in game trying to check the files but when i go to settings inside game it freezes forever until i quit. upd. fixed for some reason by restarting the device.\n",
      "have been playing for a couple of months now though its a little laggy most of the times its still a pretty good game the storyline is good character designs are also good. its fun playing with a bunch of players in co op too \n",
      "boring story and writing the game is a huge snooze fest and talking simulator with unnecessary long dialogues everything in this game feels like a chore not a single event feels fun to play. there is no quality of life improvements or endgame content you repeat the same boring daily commission and use resin worth 15 20 mins of gameplay and log out since the game launched. the only thing good about the game is the graphics but that gets old pretty quickly. the game is also very predatory.\n",
      "no controller support also... havent forgotten that this is just a bad botw clone.. i enjoyed it for a bit but im done. the gacha system is broken the open world is big beautiful and empty the combat is meh im tired of the over saturated fortnite color palette i could continue... this game isnt for me.. its for younger audiences who fall for its charm.. i feel sorry for the younger generations who genuinely havent experienced a proper open world game and praise this to the moon..\n",
      "i played this game since 8 11 20 and have been playing everyday ever since. the gameplay storyline and music are the best. sure the rewards arent great but there are great things to do and the concert was the best.\n",
      "i love the game and while i think that we should be able to pet the animals i think that there are only a few issues. the banners for example are sort of bad not really in my opinion but better than other gacha games as far as ive heard.\n",
      "this games graphics is amazing story is amazing. the best game ever in my list. but one problem is that you cant play properly without a phone with very good specs it takes so much storage. but the story and game is just amazing\n",
      "tighten the security. have been playing the game for almost a year but my cousin and friend who poured money and time into this game got hacked. the verification system should be better at this point. the updates within the game is great but the security with the players account should be too. please notice this\n",
      "excellent plot well written characters. many of the things that have been implemented into the game so far have been spot on amazing. i will continue to enjoy what it has to offer and will look forward to its many future updates to come\n",
      "its an awesome game but for some reason in the quest a cliff side hero tang wuchao disappeared after interacting with him for the flower of farsight and i couldnt beat him hence the quest cant be finished. please tell me how to fix this problem.\n",
      "the graphics gameplay character designs quest etc. are very good. the only thing is u need a very good internet connection to play it smoothly. even after reducing all the graphics to its lowest my phone still freezes. and pls add another feature to let players change the controls according to our wishes.\n",
      "disappointed the game itself is a very beautiful and fun experience for me. however 1 month ago i got my account stolen wasnt able to access my 2 years progress which is very frustrating i contacted the support but until now i still cant get it back.\n",
      "great game i decided totry it after seeing many many memes. thought it would we kinda bad. but it excceded my expectations. there is so much content in this game. i have 70 hours and i barely scratched the surface. gameplay wise is pretty great the story is pretty good too. overall a great game.\n",
      "i really love this game i play it sience the pre registration. i like how the gacha system is. and the combat mechanism is really cool. but everything is ruined by their rng system especially the artifacts. you have to spent a lot of time if youre an f2p to get the right artifact stat for your character. i tried to get viridescent with crit dmg as main stat. i spent few months and only got 1 with bad substat. and if i just spent like 2 or 3 weeks farming artifact it wont be good enough.\n",
      "it can be laggy but aside from that it is a great game. multiple characters beautiful scenery and multiple adventures i love playing it and it is a great game.\n",
      "a game about cultural diversity yet unable to make proper representations. the game developers are apparently is allergic to skin darker than cheap tan. the only black character in the game is a stereotype of scary weird girl i love her personality but her story was really weirdly racially motiveted . if the game is gonna keep messing up with underresearch its gonna dig its own grave.\n",
      "the game is very good and all really good graphic but they really need to work on the security on this game. the fact that i got hacked by a random russian gmail is really frustrating and from what i heard you have to wait for a month to get your account back. i ve already spent alot on this game and my effort is gone just like that . i ll change this back to 5 star if i ever get my account back.\n",
      "i love this game to bits and ive been playing since it came out. but oh my god please stop crashing. i dont even mind the lags i couldnt finish any of the daily commissions because the game kept crashing. somedays its worse than others but today is really really bad. i couldnt even sprint unless i want it to crash immediately. please im begging for the mobile version to be a little more bearable.\n",
      "this the best open world free play game out there im so happy and will continue to play this for a very long time and im glad this is almost exactly what its like on a pc because a lot of other games are glitchy have bad graphic design i would rate this 100 5 app would 100 recommend \n",
      " genshin impact is very fun to play if you like games that take time and effort to play you well be excited to have a good time playing genshin impact because you also get to play with multiple characters in the game will also being able to level up your characters and there weapons will getting to mk level up their ability too. and each character has their own way of fighting with the same element as other characters but with their own unique still for that character\n",
      "i love the game it has lots of things to explore many quests and really well written characters it gets boring for me sometimes but i get back to playing a while after\n",
      "latest update has annoying content. you call that a puzzle especially fschls quest. you have to align stuff with raven scope. i think it is just a glitch. it was not enjoyable but frustrating. please never ever do that time of puzzles again.\n",
      "some of the worst gacha ive ever seen. 5 star is a .6 chance... get used to drawing one 4 star weapon and nine 3 star weapons. the premium currency is extremely hard to come by on top of that. the farming grind for level and weapon materials is a huge time waster and mind numbing. kept from rated one star due to the gameplay itself being the best ive seen for a free to play game. too bad its just brought down by everything else.\n",
      "played for like more than a year beautiful graphics especially for a mobile game can take forever a few months to get the 5 star character you want with bad luck but the game is very free to play friendly and has lots of content.\n",
      "well hey there look. im not going to talk about the game lore and experience because its absolutely amazing. what im going to talk about is the logging in into a new device. lets say you write the email of your account and the pass. then suddenly the games says invalid log in or something like that. its kinda frustrating. idk why it happens so if there is any tips i would love to hear them d\n",
      "great game. only things i can see holding it back trading system doesnt exist. limited characters are too limited. banner reruns are nice but a new player friendly system to obtain them would be nice.\n",
      "i love genshin its an outstanding adventure game which i am addicted to but the thing i hate about it with passion is that it lags...why does it always have to crash at the loading screen for this reason missed out a quest which had many rewards. this has been a problem for many people i hope the company does something about this bc its literally so annoying. i would have gave it a five star if it wasnt for the crashing\n",
      "a fun game however terrible fan to creator development most of the time they dont listen to the fanbase at all.amplied racism barely any black characters and the ones who are black are terribly light. has a nation based off an asian vibe 2.9 3 characters are white pale.resin system terribly grindy and not enough per day.the currency of the game is slowly but surely depleting compared to the opening the game its honestly pitiful. otherwise the game is a good game just has some issues\n",
      "i have yet to find any mobile game that work just like genshin impact excluding honkai impact 3 of course . im a sucker for fantasy genre like ff and dq but its hard to find the time to play those on pc. the fact that genshin impact is this good on phones makes it wayyyy up top compared to other rpgs.\n",
      "the best action adventure game i have ever played. it is an open world game. the fighting is very immervise and you can actually control the way you fight. very easy controls. the world itself is very beautiful. its a magical fantasy game.\n",
      "its not a bad game i especially like the storyline and the voice acting the only problem is if youre on mobile you might not be able to see ice pathways or grass and the developers of engines impact if youre reading this can you make it a little bit more playable on mobile\n",
      "when i first downloaded it i tought i was going to uninstall it fast but now i cant stop playing i still dont get it why is this game free i mean the graphics sounds characters story and everything is just awesome and way too advanced thanks mihoyo for releasing this game and keep it up the only things i was unsatisfied about is that if you are not ready to grind you would quit it after a couple of days and the artifact system with random stats is messed up\n",
      "its been wonderful playing although there are some little bugs in the game its absolutely wonderful. it has an incredible storyline too . i recommend this to anyone who is looking for and open world anime type game.\n",
      "as a player for around 2 years now i can say it will be hard to switch to another game after this one. has the best graphics at your preference best story best background themes you name it. but it does require luck in getting those 5 star characters just a heads up.\n",
      "no doubt genshin impact is one of the best games i played so far. i would even be an ambassador for this game if i had the chance. despite that i still feel the game is gradually becoming more and more plain and boring as time goes by. have been playing since 2.2 and currently my love and hype for the game is decreased conpare to when i just started. hope hoyoverse can continue to add more fun events and improve the game \n",
      "when ever you first get the game everything is very very confusing especially for the artifacts this makes new people not want to play. when i first got the game i had no idea what was good and what was bad it took me 3 4 months of trying to figure out what was good or not i was just watching videos over and over.\n",
      "thus game is absolutely delightful the character lore is the best thing that couldve ever happend to me and the character design beautiful as ofcourse its still in the making i love how they update it every 40 days which gives us the full experience and we dont get bored. genshin impact is probably the best action fantasy game ive ever played \n",
      "best game i ever played so far. characters are quite cool but there are some point im unhappy about is that the new characters release are far more powerful than the older ones. but im still giving it a 5 since im satisfied with the graphic quality and the storage soace capacity.\n",
      "awesome the gameplay is really good and the lore is even better. it also explains old history. there are many places to explore and unlock to summarize i really like this game and is still playing.\n",
      "the game graphics are amazing it work on mobile very well with no glitches the characters are interesting to learn about and play in all its truly a great game. \n",
      "this game is really good ive onky downloaded this game 3 days ago and im already addicted it has really good character designs and loads of places to explore and have fun the only problme i have is the amount of apps i had to delete to be able to access and play this game. however it was totally worth it \n",
      "great game overall 10 10 the storylines good and all but im having a bug on the new event.in the toy castle the gaze isnt working since the purple thingys werent there but it was there before and it worked fine.please help me with this bug otherwise i wont be able to finish the toy castle event.\n",
      "its very good but i have one problem when you are in co op usually you all chat together sometime i have a issue that the chat log suddenly bug or disappear the message and if you leave and comeback again the issue is fix again. but the game is very good the chat log that i have problem. i dont know if its on the device or game just to know. thanks\n",
      "how i know if an rpg is really good one of a kind i geek out on it. this is definitely one of those games. its just that theres a lack of end game content . so that when youve leveled to the max took all the quests etc. for those people they have nothing to do except dailies. however for someone who takes its lore and exploration seriously and someone who has a job too the games events are a little fast paced. i havent even done all quests overall genshin is a really good game.\n",
      "a great game that i cant recommend on android because for some reason the devs refuse to give us controller support. game is extremely unwieldy on a touchscreen and considering ios has had controller support forever its either they simply dont care about their android players or they have some weird exclusivity deal with apple either way play it elsewhere or not at all\n",
      "i play this game for about a year now. and i gotta admit this is the first game that makes me obsessed. you gotta admit that the storyline and the music in this game is top tier. but still artifact grinding is killing those fun time but ill still consider playing genshin from now on to the future.\n",
      "i downloaded this played a little and now am hooked the graphics are amazing though i use lower settings due to being an android player. the characters all have unique backstories which pull you in. the scenery designs are stunning i could stare at them for hours even the story is extremely interesting.\n",
      "this game is really cool and its free to play there are no ads and the soundtack is amazing the graphics are insane for mobile and the game is massive. there is loads of story content and you can get all the characters for free though playing there is in game currency too . the team are very genourous in what they give out through the in game mail. also there is co op. the updates are frequent and plentiful. i love this game to the bottom of my heart and will keep playing for years. zhongli \n",
      "its kind of unfair with giving artifacts it takes months or so before getting a proper artifacts and for a character to be fully build. hope you will fix this and make it easier for us to farm for our characters.\n",
      "revolutionary for mobile gaming. out of all mobile games ive ever played this is by far the most incredible and it has a very high budget so you get breathtaking animations and top voice acting at least in jp dub . the gacha is very forgiving compared to nearly any other options out there and it is entirely optional because there is no pvp at all entirely pve and mostly solo with some coop elements. i would recommend this game to anyone hands down.\n",
      "great game as far as game play game animations and graphics. sad thing is most of the characters that drew me to the game have not even been avaliable. 80 or so complete with all game content.\n",
      "its great and its just amazing. theres just all there is to it but it could definitely become more amazing in the future with constant upgrades updates and improvements keep at it mihoyo \n",
      "honestly really loved this game the way they handled showing different cultures up until now has been amazing. but theyve totally dropped the ball with the most recent region sumeru at least according to the information given so far. they dont respect the culture it is based on and mix multiple cultures together as if they are one. the character design for the sumeru characters are horrible as well. i will change my rating if i see some improvement or if i am being to hasty with my rating.\n",
      "very interesting game theres no pay2win. alot of rewards entertaining adventure all around the map. challenging grinds. however they should add constellation toggle for characters like bennett. overall its very great game i recommended.\n",
      "best mmorpg mobile game available at the time big world 3 regions and 4 more to come a lot of characters and each of them has a unique design and gameplay style. there is no game in the current market to even compete with genshin impact right now.\n",
      "i think this is amazing but i wish we could have clothes for traveler because i started the game a few months ago and they never got outfits edit this game is amazing i really hope i get ganyu i think players should get a chance to choose there favorite character and get it for free on this years anniversary\n",
      "great game and characters tho i hope you could figure something about the lack of endgame because its starting to be a problem. also whats with all these hard puzzles that just stresses out players instead of having them enjoy. atleast put a detailed guide for these quest and puzzles so we dont have to search up on youtube for guides everytime. honestly its such a hassle.\n",
      "the game is great the storylines are great character design and lore is great but the problem is the gacha. from what i experienced i from rolling in banners were not really great it was extremely hard to get at least one 5 star while the artifact grinding is kind of like a gacha for it does not guarantee you to get the artifact you need and once you get the artifact you need it turns out to have horrible stats and sub stats. leveling artifacts is also very horrible. earning primos is hard.\n",
      "this game is awesome i should have given 5 star however there a problem i have facing many times when i enter in co op mode after sometime the message communication chat disappeared we cant able to see any message from other players while in co op mode to fix this we have to either exit or restart the game.please fix this bug.\n",
      "hello im currently not home and there is really quick event. im trying to dowload the game on phone cuz i absolutely love this game. but i have serious problem it keeps redowloading every single time it hits somethings around 13gb in total. i have 19 gb free space and samsung a30s account from europe. can someone help me i will rate higher after successful download. \n",
      "its a good game had it on my ps4 when it came out but its really not that f2p free to play friendly and it take so long to level up once your past level 30 it can get annoying but i do like the open world aspect of it and the very nice scenery\n",
      "really fun with lots of rich storyline one of the best mobile games ive played which made me really into it cause of the story. the new character designs introducing new ways to play the game also make me want to play even more hopefully im lucky enough to pull them overall a fun game you should definitely try \n",
      "this is a great game that they put time into. the story line is great but i do have to problems with it that make me want to give genshin 4 stars insted of 5. my first complant is that you have to use moblie layout if you are on a cromebook.second the game will take forever to load in and is sometimes glitchy. characters will not load and will just show there face floors sometimes full citys will not load in and you will have to climb to places.lasty starting today i can not join in today.\n",
      "the game is amazing but i think the serinitea pot still isnt working. ive been trying to place stuff outside but it wont work i can only place inside. and when i do place stuff it doesnt increase my serinitea exp. i have no idea if anyone else has complained about that yet or its just a me problem.\n",
      "the game is great when you first start out but once you hit ar40 it starts to become a grind. dont do the math on how ridiculous it is to get good artifacts weapons or characters. they are making insane amounts of money it would be great if they werent so greedy....\n",
      "i really like the graphics and the characters in the game are amazing. i enjoy the story as it goes on and on it is really fun the fighting styles of each character is also really cool and facinating but i have one disagreement. it takes soo many materials to upgrade and level up characters and the world although fun to explore too wide to find stuff.\n",
      "if youre here from ps to put to mobile dont waste your time. the game wont log you in no matter how many times you put your code. i tried 6 times it confirms it but wont do anything. almost like it wants you start over and spend more money. money hungry swines. save your wallets dont start all over stay on console. the game doesnt work as an app.\n",
      "last played in winter 2020. tried to play again recently but whenever i try to log in it states security info not verified and to contact customer service to retrieve password. i did not know my uid so they could not help me. wont be playing again i guess because i did have a lot of progress from before and i dont want to restart.\n",
      "i is so fun and free to play you can play with freinds and much more the story is amazing and the graphics as well everything is well thought out and the are always adding new quests and new people i would recommend this game to everyone.\n",
      "this is the best game that i ever played based on my experience on mobile gaming. it literally balance everything like meta and waifus or even gacha itself. it totally friendly to f2p players mainly for waifus but more importantly it has a knack ability to attract gamers with power creek attitude. hyv you actually improved from these past years where ver. 1.4 the disaster of bugs make me disappointed before. im sincerely glad you come a long way right now. \n",
      "for mobile you need a good phone tablet with enough storage processing power and nice screen to fully enjoy the graphics. pc graphics are really good. here is where the game shines. beautiful scenes and models. overall gameplay mechanics are fun and interesting. inspiration seems to take the best parts of other games on the market. gatcha design ensures game longevity.\n",
      "very fun and the exploration was convincing me to try this game included the in game lore. recommended for lore nerds you wont get bored of the mystery path youll encounter. also i was kind of disappointed about the comunity complaining about the characters skin from their own region and role name pronounce that by their own vas and about this weird black washing characters that they dont like about their original model. but it doesnt bother me much i still love this game.\n",
      "ive had a lot of fun playing this game for months now and its story is one of the best ones ive seen in a game definitely engaging and makes you wanna play. but the rewards that we get as a f2p player is worth nothing. youd expect the game to give handsome rewards to players atleast on their anniversary but this been a major disappointment. i would never recommend anyone to spend a dime on this game. its not worth it.\n",
      "so this game is literally great like i love it so much but i dont have grass or ice and i cant see my damage text it would be great like really great if u guys could fix this sooner but i appreciate u fixing the yunjin dvalin and signora glitch but please fix these and no need to rush it we can be patient i hope we can . thank you. but overall this is a great game \n",
      "game is op.... never thought i would play it this far it flexible missions or exploring you can do anything regardless this game is huge puzzle solving fights with bosses exploring scenery you name it..... eventually it needs loads of data hope you have wifi ......\n",
      "edit pretty good for a free game all in all i had fun exploring the map character designs music and animations are also good. the story overall plot needs work though. archon quest had bad writing \n",
      "good and entertaining but it takes up too much space and lags a lot.. but i think thats my fault anyways. the featured banners only stay for three weeks i think they should stay a little longer than that.\n",
      "grafically one of the best games of its genre for mobile. but the rigged pity system the lack of end game content the authoritarian measures implemented by mihoyo shutting up all player during the anniversary the anti christian lore the rigged artifacts stats built and other things the 18gb of space taken make me think that all money i invested in this game was a waste. but the gameplay the music and the fun that can be there once in a while make this game worth playing.\n",
      "a lot of accounts getting hacked be careful account security is awful and the support take too long to answer and when they do answer they reject the form even tho you typed everything right so basically your account is lost forever. at this point i believe even if you show then your credit card and id they will still say you arent the original account owner. edit i already contacted then multiple times and nothing\n",
      "please give skip story option i appreciate effort making the cut scene but some player have a short time to play game. at least when we do auto dialogue story please dont stop at aether prologue. let it be auto choice so i can do other work while they talk each other.\n",
      "the graphics and story are an absolute 10 10..thats all that is really going for it fighting is repetitive and grinding for hours just to get the wrong items the primo to 5 rate is absolutely outrageous this game could definitely be a little more generous.\n",
      "ive been playing this game since the first week of release but i stopped for about a year due to school. since ive come back ive noticed a few problems if any new player wants to know about this game i recommend watching a couple videos on youtube to know what the pros and cons are. its an amazing game and i do not regret downloading it on my phone and pc.\n",
      "an awesome game i totally recommend playing it you can have a great adventure complete quests and turn into different characters along the way at the beginning you can even choose the anime girl or the anime boy i rate this game five stars \n",
      "i love this game. its just i feel the endgame gets too boring and ive reached this stage where the events are fun but im sure yall can do better. also the graphics cud be optimised better. also if there is a way to disable constellations it wud be better cause content creators who already c6 their characters cud showcase f2p guides with c0 for example. also i enabled c6 bennet is one of the reasons why i ask for this feature. thanks for this game as it made my mobile experience better .\n",
      "enjoyable good quality game but i reccomend playing it on a venue that is not a tablet or phone. there is a noticeable amount of heat generated when playing it on my galaxy s20 ultra so i play it mostly on my ps5. the game does have monetary transaction features so play contientiously and responsibly. also this game supports online multi player features. finally it also requires an online account with a profile passwords and all that stuff.\n",
      "its an amazing game which allows you to fight monsters and find treasure. you can find ingredients and cook your own food which helps you character get there health back after a battle. i hope all the people who have enjoyed this game will agree with me. out of all the games i have played this is by far my favorite.\n",
      "i love this game from the grafics to the cool gameplay and even the abilities. i think that it is a great game and i highly recomend downloading it although it takes a while to download it is still fun.\n",
      "really love this game great story. every character is fun to play. but here in asia india i get very high ping. when i first started playing i used to get around 160 170ms with wifi. and now when i play with wifi i get around 200 300 and when i play with mobile data i get around 300 400. but when i update the game 3 4mb sec easily which i think is okay. but back when i used to play bgmi pubg i used get 24 28ping ms with the same wifi. please mihiyo fix the issue over all great game\n",
      "the game has many things to offer such as nice scenery lore and music with cool combat......however despite all thw support we still havent got controller support for android....i hope they do add and if possible support for all controllerz.....just for this i m dropping the raring to 4\n",
      "i couldnt really play the app sadly. as for my first time and till this day i would keep getting the insufficient storage . which has been bugging me for awhile. but the game looks very beautiful and have heard a lot. and i wish to experience it in the future.\n",
      "stop whitewashing sumeru characters. it would be different although still horrible if these were random characters made to represent the culture of the south asian arabic etc. and just happened to have light skined characters but these characters are based on actual historical figures and not at all close in skin tone to their original inspiration. it may not seem important to you but it is to many of us to see accurate representation of these beautiful cultures and people. 5 stars when fixed\n",
      "the game is good but when i play it my ms says is 95 then. suddenly going up to 140 for some reason and sometimes it lags a little bit in the title screen and when the loading screen loads it suddenly says genshin impact has stopped workin and my internet my is pretty stable so please fix this thank you\n",
      "this is an awesome and huge triple a game which would normally cost hundreds of dollars to acquire. the review limit of 500 characters just makes it impossible to describe the many mechanics ambiences stories events characters soundtracks and much more this game has to offer. i definitely recommend it especially on pc.\n",
      "genshin is a wonderful game with so many characters and lots of amazing storyline but it takes up so much space nowadays. at this rate more people specifically mobile game players will have to give it up or just wait until they can get something with more storage.\n",
      "love the attension the details in game. i love the open world map so much to explore. this is definately a game for people who likes to chill and relax. there are over a 300 bg music all great. and lotttts of backgrond lore. been playing for 2 month now. ar40. loving it. i do hope that updates are scedual a bit more frequently tho. the story line is dope. btw lisa need more role in the story. pls make more quest with her.\n",
      "honestly i thought i was too late to play the game but no ones late to join in the fun. this is like dragon nest but with grinding and gacha i love it. if youre a fan of such games like dragon nest or honkai you should really play. again its never too late to join in the fun. it may be slow at first but youll definitely get addicted and get the hang of it especially when you play with your friends. its easy from there to grind.\n",
      "its a massive wip but the game has sound character structure and the visuals when the settings are put on max are absolutely stunning been playing ever since the beta version first came out \n",
      "not a bad game but it needs some quality of life adjustments. as updates roll out the size of the game is quickly becoming unmanageable for phone players. they also promise 20 rolls at the start but you only actually get 17 rolls in all. the pity system is also pretty unmerciful. even with a welkin bonus daily commissions you dont get enough in game currency for a single roll a day. i feel a single roll a day isnt much to ask for. thats only a 5 every 2 3 months.\n",
      "genshin impact is a good game with a gacha system great characters and has a really interesting story. the reason why im rating this a 3 5 and not a 5 5 is because hoyoverse seems doesnt listen to the players feedback too much. there is a ton of playable content with lore in it but none of it is permanent so if you miss the event then you never get to experience important things.\n",
      "to put it straight i absolutely love this game the details and the lore make it hard to put down. i can spend hours just wandering or playing with friends. its honestly just an unhealthy addiction that is worth my time.\n",
      "fun game one of the best i have played but it ends up being a huge grind the mechanics in the game are janky and once u get to level 50 the game gets stupid hard enemies start to be almost invulnerable and the game stops being fun also the wish odds are dumb everytime i do wish it keeps giving me the same item or character and not in a good way...also it not vary rewarding\n",
      "needs target lock on for phone players i get hit in the back because i try to change video angle also the game has a big problem with enemies resetting just in the middle of fight they just walk back and their health resets to full and dead enemies respawning \n",
      "ive been playing for more than a month now and i really love the game but ever since the new update i can open the game anymore it always says 4206 i cant fix it even though i tried everything and i think this only happens in asia server because i tried europe and then it started loading can you please fix this \n",
      "imagine falling in love with this game with its lore and then eventually finding a character that you really love but you missed the first banner you saw. now imagine its been literally 9 months since the last time you saw that character. its ridiculous that people have to wait a literal year sometimes for a character rerun when it would be so easy to fix. theyve also recently been re running the same characters so theres no chance of getting the one you want.\n",
      "love the storyline. the graphics are amazing even if you set it in lowest. the character s skill animation are supervb. im just unlucky with artifacts but its still good.\n",
      "i really love the game graphics storyline characters etc. although im really disappointed by the rewards and representation for poc people. please listen more to your community making the characters skin tone tan doesnt mean dark skin . if youre going to make characters based on historical figures please take their race physical features into consideration.\n",
      "the 5 star characters are so weak unless you get multiple copies of the 5 star characters. oh the drop rate is so pathetic that it is not going to happen ever. poor game design in this aspect where you are stuck with useless characters and you cannot advance unless you pay for it. oh i cannot even get my uid from the website nor copy from the game.\n",
      "this game is like my fav game i love love love it buuuuuuuut my problem is that i play this game on my phone and the graphics are low i cant see ice grass and my dmg texts and whenever i look at a water it glows so bright like veryyyyyy bright and also theres a glitch where the enemys hp bar just disappears whenever i use heizou eula or fischls burst i want it to be fix on mobile pls do anything you can to fix it\n",
      "this game is good overall....but once u reach endgame theres basically nothing to do except wait for new event and building character....this game would be perfect if theres an endgame content...and the reward i mean primogems for doing event getting lower than the earlier patch...not a very f2p friendly game but i still love it\n",
      "hello i need help. after finishing the mini update that is sometimes happening in mobile i exited the app after that when i try to open it again it keeps crashing now. i dont want to uninstall and reinstall the game because the size is si large and i dont have enough data to do it.\n",
      "love this game is so good and there is so much characters but one issue if your ping gets to high or low it bugs out the best part about this game is no ads and another concern whet you download the game it takes really long to set up but it also saves progress\n",
      "good item and the package is great. i mostly enjoyed the emergency food hidden in the box. because of my depression i couldnt sleep and this item helped me to gain some reason not to sleep more and now im certified ceo of saturn in charge of taking care of moons around me. i hope that people will try this item so that they could feel what it feels like to lose a 50 50.\n",
      "the best game i ever played so far. the story and other mechanics are so fun and majestic. the game that will take you to a roller coaster ride of different emotions. although my luck isnt that good at least i have good characters that can accomplish those quest. but there is only one problem that i see the storage of it. i know that my phone can still handle the next updates but then i am worrying what can it be in the future. i hope you can help us to lessen the storage. thanks \n",
      "incredible mobile game its no wonder its so popular. update version 3.0 is simply a masterpiece. it is the perfect blend of art gameplay and character development. truly an amazing time to come back or even start playing for the first time \n",
      "early game fun late game is a grind once you hit ar 50 or above without burning out youll see there isnt much end game content usually you wait for a new event or version for content in the mean time you can use resin and do daily commissions lack of a clear end game docks a star otherwise great story characters gameplay and interesting worldbuilding\n",
      "i dont know why im having these problems as it sometimes doesnt let me switch the characters while combat and there was also an issue with the cursor for rotation. please check regarding these problems. thank you. and i really love this game.\n",
      "as an f2p its painful but its still enjoyable. edit as player who experienced the 1st anniversary im not mad because they just give 10 pulls. im just disappointed that theres no content or celebration to the 1st anniversary... ill still play because i enjoyed the game a lot and story. the system of gambling just to have better performance is painful but you can ignore it and still play the game but with a little dissatisfaction. recommended if your a casual player\n",
      "it was suppose to be good but theres too many glitches.. like i can see through buildings and rain becomes green and objects suddenly become colorful etc.. please fix it.. my friend just recommended me this game and i just started it and i already have a pretty bad experience here..\n",
      "its been like 5 or 4 months since ive played this game i love it its fun and kinda addictive the problem is hoyo gives primogems but its not enough like events but cant do 4 pulls so its much appreciated if there are more ways to get a lot of primogem also if u lose a 50 50 next is gurranteed but why lose a 50 50 again it will be good if this is fixed because most are f2p who cant afford primogems\n",
      "overall its an amazing game amazing grapichs awesome storyline and a character that suits everyones style. though i wouldnt reccomend playing on a chromebook like me because it tends to be very laggy.\n",
      "ive watched others play it and it seems like good game but no matter what i do i could never play it because it was too laggy or would ask me to log in again before it even started i wish there was an option to turn down the graphics so that it would be actually playable.\n",
      "i get the game is supposed to be hard but i literally cant get through this quest like its impossible or something each and every time i try to wish i always get a weapon instead of the character i actually saved up to make a 10 wishes with primogem and got some stupid weapon. you have to play countless quests and spend a year or so to get 1 character and its also very easy to die and even when you try to avoid dangerous enemies they still attack you. i think the game is fine though.\n",
      "this is a great story game so many quest and so very a perfect way to spend free time tho if you dont keep up with it and not play it for awhile it gets quite confusing so you would have to learn the ropes again\n",
      "for a game that touts so many unique playable characters from the story they sure make it hard to get them. and im not talking about pulls im talking about limited banner runs that take months to a year to come around again with no other way to get characters you want. i enjoy the story and would happily pay to get characters like venti and childe but i dont even have the option. im only in liyue story btw \n",
      "the game is incredibly good. have been playing for nearly a year now at ar55. events are good storyline is good and even if the artifact system isnt great it provides a way for even high ar players to be challenged. but the new golden apple archipelago event amazing. fischls mirage however that. that alone made me drop my rating from 5 stars to 1 just because they made the mechanics really badly. great concept horrible execution. one of the worst puzzles i have ever seen tbh.\n",
      "a great game overall with events and a on your own time type of storyline. the gacha is optional so thats a definite plus aside from the fact you dont get very many free primos in general unless you actively look for chests the currency system is well thought out too. my main and only actual complaint would be the fact that banners are too expensive if you do save for them.\n",
      "i would put it as 5 stars but it takes way to much time for it install a new update.you cant skip dialog either. if these are somehow fixed or a bit better i could change it to 5 stars but right now it still needs a few more updates even about the updates \n",
      "the game is such a wonderful adventure game through experience i have a recommendation that in settings there should be a turn on and off damage text for potato phones grass ice bridge etc. for potato phones i hope thisll be reach iut the developers that is all thank you\n",
      "ive been playing this game everyday for 2 years its really that captivating. the routine update gives it a fresh feeling everytime. i wish theyd give keyboard controller support for android too for more comfort playing using tablet\n",
      "the game is great and has a lot of potential. the world is vast and beautiful the characters are given every bit of detail they all need and the events are fun. however this game lacks permanent replayable content which makes the end game user experience rather unsatisfactory. if youre looking for a game to play for a bit genshin impact is good. but it isnt a good time investment as of now. this game has a lot of potential that a lot of people are waiting to see unraveled.\n",
      "the game is very good i love it but it really needs an optimization so that more people can play it and enjoy it without lags another bad thing is that there arent as many and long quests as id want... even after releasing a new location there arent any quests left in less than a week.\n",
      "so far so good. about 20 hours in and its been a blast to play. youll pick up the mechanics quickly. if i had to give one piece of advice just have fun with it and level the characters u like. try to focus on just 5 for early game 1 of each element update been playing for a while since launch. my only real problem with this now is that if u close the app out to answer a call or anything u have to reload the entire thing. very annoying\n",
      "its a good game but it has become too hard to play it on mobile there are too many crashes and freezes throughout the game when i am playing it. i have been playing scince day 1 and it ran perfectly fine on max graphical settings now its cant even run properly when its on the lowest possible settings. the freezeing usually occurs two weeks prior to the new update but thats only when its at its worst. can you please fix this i would really live to play the game more.\n",
      "the game is phenomenal but ever since the 2.8 update i cant login my account i tried logging in different accounts but nothing after the verification it just stays on the login screen please fix this this is such a major inconvenience and i couldnt even play the game\n",
      "honestly it is a best game but after a while it really gets me bored for all the grinding you been working to. and not just that the anniversary is a complete dissapointment to imagine that if you are f2p or free to play player and you played so hard in a year and the rewards are just 10 spin that you can get in just a month of playing this. clearly that the voice and wishes of the player is not working in this game afterall.\n",
      "i loved this game in the past so much but it start to have many glitches here and there i can dell with that but the text damage disappear i cant see any and i tried to fix the settings and so one i even contract you but you kept on ignoring sadly i would prefer the old mihiyo over the new company\n",
      "this game is amazing although it takes a lot of storage space. the graphics characters plot and etc. are amazing youll find yourself simping the characters lmao. \n",
      "hello i already had an account in this game. i deleted the game once and reinstalled it today i logged in with the same gmail but everything went from the beginning. is there a way to get my account back or everything is deleted its a very good game but if everything is deleted i dont really have the motivation to go through the stages from the beginning. i used google for translation sorry for possible mistakes help me please \n",
      "one of the best exploration and discovery games with new content dropped every six weeks. play it on pc unless you have a great phone.\n",
      "i have been unable to load into the game for almost an hour. i have uninstalled and reinstalled twice and all this is being done on a brand new laptop. if the game cant be played on my laptop it should say so instead of me getting my hopes up to finally boot up the game just for it to crash for the 100th time.\n",
      "4 stars after 2 years of playing this game ar59 the game is nice but its all about quests quests quests and some new areas to explore every 2 patches. the game is really good but the content is repeatable. i just wish they add a buffed character ittos arms was a disappointment\n",
      "great game but i suggest that maybe it would be a good idea to put in mini games to farm for primos when players have no more quests to complete or get bored of the events so that theres more things to participate in. its also a drive for players to continue playing until their fave banner eventually arrives.\n",
      "the newer content seems bland. new characters dont excite me anymore and neither do events with rewards that are determined entirely by randomness and consist mostly of useless decorations for the housing system. hoyoverse i know you can do better. tell your colleagues in china who brainstorm the new content to give us more characters with realistic body proportions and darker skin and less useless decorations for the teapot \n",
      "gacha aspect is a total waste of money and not super great with how likely you are to get a character not fan of the artifact system either its extremely boring and repetitive. the new region in sumeru just came out and if any poc are hoping to see some representation in the desert region you wont get it im a very light skin basically white hispanic and when you swatch the dark characters theyre the same colour as me. they just look dark because the other characters are white as paper\n",
      "are you going to make interesting designs for the playable characters yet or do we have to wait another two years the enemies in sumeru look amazing and yet the sumeru chara designs are so different from them they dont look like their from sumeru much less a desert like nation and theyre very plain and boring. i wish the sumeru characters and enemies had more in common they look like theyre from completely different nations.\n",
      "i loved and enjoyed the game at first. i was one of the whales of this game. from weeklin top up battle pas ive always bought from scratch. its been 1 year since ive played this game for now just once a year it doesnt give a single appropriate present. i regret that i wasted so much money. but i thank you for the experience and the good game. its just that im very disappointed as the game gets more and more greedy. thankyou.\n",
      "actually i played for almost 2 years for this game at first the game actually its so friendly and player can receive humble gift from dev. but this time you should play so hard and you should doing extra time for this game. for gamer or streamer i think its no problem cz they working environment in that area. but for a worker like office worker labor etc. better not wasting your extra time for silly quest adventure many more. i played this game for filling my free time. but not rec. anymore.\n",
      "5 stars on every single aspect of this game. music graphic gameplay story all is perfect. this game fits for casual players who really want to enjoy the environment which gave us high quality music and the best open world experience. but theres one thing u should care about yeah... the gacha. u cant collect waifus easily on this game as a f2p player u have to grind and play the game everyday for resources to pulling your waifus. anyway enjoy the game i really recommend it.\n",
      "the gameplay is great the music is lovely and the story is fascinating. unfortunately recent character designs have shown that the genshin art team is highly disrespectful towards traditionally non white light skinned cultures and the upcoming sumeru characters come off as ignorant at best and racist at worst. its frustrating to see a game with so much love put into it go down this path.\n",
      "i personally never actually keep playing a game for more than a month but i played genshin almost a year now. genshin is the game that i hate to love and love to hate and it help me to go through dark times. keep making a lot of event with a lot of primogems as rewards and itll be nice if you increase the max resin per day d my humble suggestion add a feature in serenita teapot like the practice wood thingy that can show your damage output\n",
      "its really good if youre looking for a game where you can just adventure and also the story is really good and when you fight the fighting animation is immaculate thats all from me though you should check out the game itself.\n",
      "not the luckiest player but genshin gave me the characters i need to survive the early game and im glad for it. also theres a bunch of stuffs in game that youll never run out of things to do so thats a plus as well. theres also plenty enough events that generously gave a lot of stuff which really does help a f2p player like myself. the only issue i have was probably the optimization for lower end devices but considering how beautiful the game is well cant complain about that.\n",
      "i play this on ps4 and i love how smoothly it plays. edit the sound was resolved thanks mihoyo and i got more into the game and i really like it. i honestly cant find anything i dont like about the gameplay. its a wonderful game that has truly stunning graphics d\n",
      "the translation into latin american spanish is simply terrible. texts and dialogues are full of misspellings and grammar mistakes making it really hard to read and understand. mihoyo should consider translating the game into a more neutral spanish that can be understood by all.\n",
      "this game is really fun to play but there is a bug for my gameplay my adventure rank isnt leveling up when i surpass the aventure xp i still dont level up please fix this bug.\n",
      "to people reading this you will be pushed around for playing some anime game in school its happened to me before although this game is really fun once you get the hang of it it really is worth the time not the amount of images of ganyu saved on your phone. oh and hoyoverse be careful not to get cancelled because of the booba physics.\n",
      "this game is really good and is exceptional from other games. there are a lot of theories and mysteries in this game and we can explore the game a lot people who has 100 exploration might be really bored since they dont have anything to explore anymore but for newbies or people who are still playing the game its really fun. you can make new friends grind for characters and a lot of other fun things. i hope 2.7 will be released soon.\n",
      "for the 2.8 update i didnt get the pre install notification and when i tried to login it just shows a whole thing about some other update so i tried to refresh my page and it just showed the same thing over and over again. idk if i can get into my acct at all now \n",
      "until mihoyo give us better anniversary rewards i will keep my 2 star review. its great game with quality and stuff also very rewarding but since they gave us like what 10 intertwined fates and event okay maybe the event is good but still . we have low expectations but what mihoyo. also dont get me wrong its great game but its 1 year anniversary bruh 1 year playing this game and what we get 9 3 star weapon and 1 copies of barbara probably anyhow im ran out of words and this game is 2 .\n",
      "amazing game . lot of fun . but as the game progress obtaining primogems become difficult and which can cause new player to not able to catch up with characters release .\n",
      "network error ever time i enter the game i i dont know why this happens to me every friday saturday ive tried everything but it doesnt seem to work doing this every time makes me wanna delete the game i hope you can fix the problem as soon as possible\n",
      "love this game while playing on pc feels a lot more optimized the mobile version easily has some of the best layout ive ever seen for such an expansive game its perfectly fine with its resources even when youre free to play. of course the classic gacha elements make it frustrating at times but overall still very enjoyable 3\n",
      "an extremely fun and engaging rpg excellent fantasy world and story that gets better and more complex each patch. with the additions of more varieties of characters there is really something for everyone\n",
      "its an amazing game and i have been playing it for more than a year and it requires some brain juice for many puzzles and its storyline is not even half complete as of now only 3 main area with many interesting sub areas have unlocked now its time for the 4th main area to unlock in a few months super excited for it but it does not have special events like diwali and holi for india would be highly appreciated please hoyoverse. for developers thank you for this amazing game \n",
      "ive downloaded this game on at least 10 devices trying to play the game but it wont let me it keeps saying hint insufficient storage space try clearing data and then download despite me having 10 gigabytes of storage and making a different acount for the game please help ive tried everything on youtube and google regarding error code 9907 edit exactly how many gigs does the game need cuz according to the devs it needs more than 10 and thats absurd.\n",
      "i really really like this game cuz it provides you with many quests to do and its really interesting like the animation the story and the voicing keep the good work \n",
      "i love genshin impact so much its an amazing game the new update with sumaru is absolutely amazing and everywhere else is so beautiful it not easy but not to difficult to play and the controls are easy to use. everything about this game is amazing \n",
      "this game is fun but theres not much do do at high ar level not much quests pretty much only commisions and the story quests that are unlocked with keys. at 19 00 the maintenece was still there and i was waiting all month for the banners to come out but other then those problems im happy and got my favorite character klee at 31 pity along with c1 heizou.\n",
      "today i went on genshin impact to find out that i was logged out and had to relogin after logging back in i was stuck inside a random ar 2 account. i used the same email and password as my original account i spent so much money and hard work on my account just to lose it i hope there is a way to fix this im very disappointed as i really liked this game and i wouldnt like to redo the whole game again.. thank you \n",
      "while this game may require a lot of money to get a character you want it is still fair. the pity system is easy to understand and everything is very smooth. i mostly play for the lore because i find the world of teyvat intriguing especially with the new chasm quests adding to it. but as much as i like it there is a few problems like the sheer size of storage it takes. many cant have as much storage as needed and i think itd be better if they decompressed the resources to a smaller amount\n",
      "i started playing this game cause my friend told me about it. at first i thought i wont play long but i kind of got addicted to it. even tho game is really good i dont think if mobile players will keep up. especially since new region is coming out on next version and it probably will take a lot of space on the drive.\n",
      "honestly i am beyond disappointed by this games puzzles. the new event gave many players a headache instead of enjoyment. stop this hard puzzles. these are not necessary for the game i wont be changing my mind sooner. if these hard puzzles continue then im afraid many players will quit the game including me.\n",
      "i absolutely love this game but for some reason it is very glitchy and i could barely play it on some parts. im not getting rid of it bc i love this game dearly and never in my whole life thought id love it but look at me now im still playing. everythingbis wonderful and i love the plot and fighting.\n",
      "mihoyo carefully crafted a gorgeous open world with an amazing ost. the gameplay is fun and can become advanced with the right characters. new lands and adventures are regularly added at no cost the wish system is forgiving and offers a guaranteed 5 after a set number of wishes so you can plan for the characters you want.\n",
      "overall nice and one of the best game ever. but needs some minor improvements. give optional download for voice pack. tired of reading through side mission sometimes availability of voice pack would make the experience the best. increase more co op and multiplayer activities. fix latency ping issues. except these i find everything else as best in genshin impact\n",
      "this game is full of fun when they said open world they ment it. you can go almost anywhere and climb just about anything. such a beautiful game too the voice acting everything is so good i find myself not skipping like i normally would. try the game out if you have not. its worth it.\n",
      "i dont have anything to say about bugs or glitches just a little advice for new players. as a person whos been a player for almost 2 years now id say ive done almost everything there is to do and i cant play like i used to. my advice is dont rush and dont do everything at once. take it slow and enjoy new content can take a while to catch up if you do so.\n",
      "most of the game is great. the music the art the combat etc. is all fantastic but being time limited by resin is definitely a hindrance especially with how much you have to grind to actually build characters. but by far the worst part is the business decisions by mihoyo like how the weapon banner is still a scam although it used to be much worse and how character interactions wont work because of shaky reasoning that doesnt really make sense. barring these the game is pretty good.\n",
      "best adventure mobile game ever adventure is top notch graphics are for anime lovers and also great storys are best and make sense also particular character also have their own story that i love book story drawing and animation top notch. but one problem when we go near water fall some glitches happens and please fix network issue for mobile when i play on pc network is superb but when i play on mobile network issue happen not much internet problem but in fighting seen please solve \n",
      "fun open world game with many likeable characters and a decent story. updates often enough and doesnt require much time investment to keep up after a certain point.\n",
      "i love it sure theres a little less to do later in take it from me whos ar 59 but its still very fun i enjoy the way it looks and plays quite a lot. yes its hard to get 5 stars and you might not get the one you want. but its just a game yes its fun but its a free game. im very happy with it for the fact its free. could have better research put into some characters for sure though definitely sumeru ones but overall its okay. again fun but just okay. for a free game.\n",
      "nice free to play game but thats it. mihoyo doesnt listen to its players and gives bare minimum in. if you want to play it dont pay attention to the gacha or anything else just be free 2 play and expect bare minimum because thats all you will get from a game that could have otherwise been amazing. lumine representation has been intentionally bad as well.\n",
      "i really love this game. you can immediately tell that the creators put a lot of work into this from the graphics to the character designs to the story its all really well thought out. there is one problem though the game takes up wayyy to much storage. if i had better storage i would play everyday. other than that 10 10 great game.\n",
      "been playing this on pc today i downloaded after clearing out 18gb free space things i like the cutscenes are there which explains the huge size of 16gb and the games kinda optimizated to give 30 45 fixed without much issue i locked it at 30 and im barely having overheating issues but taking settings up a notch will definitely effect it though i like it for rn \n",
      "version 2.8 new event sucks its very stressful and not rewarding at all. each domain is very stressful hard can cause headaches when playing it and not fun at all. after completing each domain it doesnt equal the compensation us players. and the new event has a lot of bugs especially with the night ravens eyes in fischls domain.\n",
      "i like the graphics and everything on mobile but the problem is that mobile players cant see the damage atack text on the screen ice for element burst for cryo characters and grass and its bothering me as well if you could squeeze in those stuff in the next update mobile players and me would appreciate it.\n",
      "this game has so much lore. after a little over a year of playing im still incredibly hooked the backstory of the game and even the characters regions and everything down to the last detail is amazing \n",
      "its slow when i play and it keeps kicking me out the pass 2 times after i defeat the 3 crystals of the wind it just kicked me off of the game this game is the worst game ive ever played idk why they dont fix it and make sure its right the first time\n",
      "this game is absolutely amazing. i cant even describe how amazing it is. the lore adventure graphics animations voice acting character designs everything is wonderful about it.\n",
      "the game is overall good i play on the ps so storage isnt really a problem but once i was downloading it on the computer it kept crashing so i couldnt play it. also storage is a huge problem for moblie or computer.\n",
      "beautiful art and graphics incredible characters and super deep lore. its a little bit grueling to get primogems but thats ok and its still very fun even if you dont grind.\n",
      "it was a fun game although its heavily p2w also it crashes a lot i use to play it on my old phone and tried downloading it on my new phone and it has a lot of freezing issues although the game is still fun and the story is compelling and nice so i cant complain to much\n",
      "kinda struggling in the early game but recently its been a really great experience... the artifact farming is still kinda annoying tho so far thats the only problem i experienced. also hoyovers im waiting for the next patch okay.... so uhm... please make it good. i dont want you guys getting swarmed again especially on twitter . also one more thing why does my google in game account cannot synchronize with hoyolab account im already ar 55 but in hoyolab im still on lvl 1 ..\n",
      "the game is amazing all the scenery the lore and the characters but i feel like there should be a constellation toggle it would be really useful and i know everyone would appreciate it so much if they accidentally put a constellation on a character they didnt want on them i would put 5 stars it that was in the game.\n",
      "this game sucks it cant even run on chromebook keyboard and mouse i tried finding the keyboard and mouse settings but all im seeing is touch screen i have bad experience with this game even the sounds errors sometimes and the graphics and smoothness is trash bro i pretty much prefer the console version than this trash\n",
      "im a returning player and the game has a massive resource pack which i dont mind but what made me rate this a 2star is cuz i was downloading the resources and didnt quite completed it 9gb out of 13gb resources was downloaded and just now the new update came and when i updated the game the resources were back to 0. all those 9gb data wasted. should atleast make us finish downloading the resources before telling us to update the game. thank you for wasting my time energy and data.\n",
      "umm.. i think its good game if u have a high end device.. it has a big map that u can explore best graphics... 1 problem is there always a frame from while fighting...\n",
      "everything about this game is just perfect.thank you for putting effort and time for making this game characters lore regoins and everything.i really enjoy playing this game.its very better than other gacha games and characters design are very good even though some of designs are like characters from honkai impact but they are still very pretty and detailed.\n",
      "the game started glitching when i installed it on my new phone whenever i want to fight dvalin and la signora. i dont think my phone is the problem because it is very new and is also a gaming phone. please fix it. i cant finish my weekly boss fight because of the glitch.\n",
      "works well on pc. the thing is i want to play on mobile for everywhere use and sadly it disappointed me. even with snap 870 and high ookla score loading screen and mob spawns just takes too long. if this cant ever be resolved ill just let all my welkins finish and find a new open world. what a waste. reply oh please. i wouldnt comment this if i know that my device cant handle it. also qualcomm snap 845 is the minimum. cant you guys read your own requirements \n",
      "it is a three star for good story very deep lore and good characters and background story and nice graphics. 2star because of some glitches like crashing and no damage text grass and ice for low end phone please devs fix at least damage text \n",
      "i love the game but i really want something like spiral abyss. the events are something but they never stay and spiral abyss is getting boring. please add more looping content decrease the prices on genesis crystals or give us more resin fix how we get artifacts.\n",
      "honestly one of the best games right now free to play enough content to keep me busy zero ads and not much is paywalled. the soundtrack is amazing and i still cant believe such a detailed open world is available on mobile. of course its not perfect but the pros definitely outweigh the occasional cons. i hope to be playing this game for a long time\n",
      "this game is great no doubt in it thank the developers for it but there is 1 major issue i have one of the highest end hardware in industry snapdragon 888 but i still cant get 60fps even in medium graphics hope hoyoverse try to optimize it which could be awesome in long terms\n",
      "mobile always has issues with loading after the update. currently 2.7 stuck at elemental loading screen and cannot play the game. artifact grind sucks too. so dont play it. update got help from developers still did not fix problem.\n",
      "its very good game but the issue i am having with the experience is the controls as it use a moblie layout and not pc layout and trying to glide when play on a chrome book is to me very difficult to glide and do the challege of gettinf a licence for gliding with with doing the challege that amber\n",
      "thid game is so nice and i love how you can discover diferrent characters monsters and world. i also like that you can do challenges or quest to win primogems . i do recomend this game it might be hard but with practice you will be able to do anything.\n",
      "this game is actual trash. they gate progress and game mechanics with rng gear that has lower rates for the stats everyone uses on top of betting on a 1 10 chance on whether or not its the right stat. its been an issue since the game released and they havent addressed it at all. ive spent months wasting my time farming for singular pieces just so i can use a character. its highly recommended you stay away from this game if you have any self respect.\n",
      "hm i love the game i just got collei today but some glitches happen while i was doing the event the golden archipelago it said reconnecting to server even tho but wifi was great and it all restarted up to the start but its alright the puzzle of the event was hard but i still love the game thank you hoyoverse.\n",
      "amazing the graphics are amazing and the stories are so good it is so addicting 1 slight problem when i interact with jean during the holy lyre incident she disappeared and i was talking to a wall.\n",
      "really good game. a couple of annoying characters why do they sound like small children why does paimon exist but a beautiful world. unfortunately the game has bugs which prevent me from completing main storyline quests so im stuck until an update fixes it.\n",
      "this is the my favourite app on my phone literally. i love the characters the landscapes from mondstad liyue sumeru to inazuma late review but this is an awesome game. i would love mihoyo to make more of these games keep it up mihoyo and your hard work for the players entertainment i personally love the game. but sometimes when i pre intsall it will still tell me to download and i have do delete the game and install it again so can you fix that \n",
      "awesome love the graphics story quests all of it though i do keep dying from losing stamina and falling off of cliffs . my fault though.\n",
      "the game continues to keep improving devs care a lot about this game and its community. there are regular updates to fix spelling errors across over 100 languages small patches that prevent bugs and glitches caused by characters and enemies and even recognizing major problems to be fixed in a future update devs are hardworking and the content generated is amazing if i had to note my 1 issue is that the daily comms. need to hold a higher priority on quests that only appear as a daily comms.\n",
      "the upcoming 3.0 update really highlights the racism and colorism at play here. although borrowing names and cultural practices from africa and south asia for the new region every single friendly or playable character is extremely pale or maybe has a light tan at most. this in combination with sumeru having been colonized and with the indigenous people having been pushed out into the desert is not a good look. truly disappointed since there is such potential for a rich story.\n",
      "loooooovvvvvveeeeeee it it has such good graphics and i rly love the build of the story also the characters and their background is really good too i love the story format and i love the art of the characters and the way they put fairy tales \n",
      "no controller support also on display button location is absurd. no way i can play more than one minute like that. plus it seems to be zelda botw engine with cheesy anime characters.\n",
      "hello hoyoverse its almost 470 days i started playing this game i love everything in game starting from graphics gameplay audio etc. but the only thing i dont like is too much space due to dead maps like enkannomia chasm underground mines please remove them and make them time limited event maps please or make some daily quests in those arears too to make them alive please. and if possible please increase daily quests too. thank you.\n",
      "amazing graphics scenery and music. lore is interesting and game is fun. but the lack of diversity is unforgivable at this point the very few pigmented playable characters there are get whitewashed at almost every turn. and the npcs with pigment are all enemies which is just a slap in the face. not to mention sumeru which is based on a mix of middle eastern and south asian cultures has some of the whitest characters yet to be brought into the game. doris design stereotyping is racist af.\n",
      "the game is crazyyyy..crazily addicted the characters storylines scenery places are all superb wonderful..you might get lost hours just by wondering around feasting your eyes to the beaulty it behold. played since dis 2021 still got lots of treasures to be discovered this game never fail to mesmerize me. oh the game feel real alive highly recommended \n",
      "i seen other people play it and i tried but first of all i cant get in at all i tried making one but i had to redo it like a million times and when i finally got it it says i have too much space which i dont btw. and when i click somthing to look at it is was too glichy wont recamend to chrome users game if your reading this make sure everyone that gets this game have to get in because if you cant get in that is a waste of time \n",
      "working great though itd be nice if there was a little more customization options for the controls. i cant find where to enlarge and rearrange buttons.\n",
      "i really like this game and its so fun to play even using my mobile phone its very comfortable to be honest but please genshin i hope you can let the others like me see the damage from the characters.mine was overlocked whenever i try the medium graphics which is the one will make me see the damage from them but sadly i cant even tho i still have free 18 gb. i badly want to see it but im just hoping f its gonna add that thing. i know some phones can see other damage already.tnks\n",
      ". id love to see the artifact system change. the game is good overall but i think that if the daily commissions gave more primos i would give it 5 stars. the game is really bad at running on poor devices and my phone has a really bad time when im trying to fight a horde of enemies at once. other than that i think that the game is good.\n",
      "very recommended i joined genshin impact like 2 months ago i so far got only 1 5star character im sad abt it but just a request please make your 5 star rates a bit higher ive spent money in the game already and i keep on getting 4stars i still like em but itd be nice to have more 5stars. anyways the characters are amazing and the lore is so interesting.\n",
      "i loved the game on my iphone but since switching to android i can no longer use wireless controllers to play. kind of p sses me off that i was able to on my iphone from the get go but android doesnt have that option.\n",
      "i love it since i first started i was amazed by the aesthetic and the design of nature in the game. and as well as the characters. great quality i must say its very relaxing and one of my comfort games to play. i also love each nation that is out right now and im enjoying the game so far.\n",
      "this game is well deserving of its high ratings its great on mobile and a laptop format great missions rewards and its a game that certainly gets better with time \n",
      "i have played the game for about 2 years now. spent few hundreds participated in almost all events and almost never missed the daily commissions. i gotta say the game is very engaging and has a lot of in games mechanics. the visual is breath taking. the downside is old characters becoming weaker compared to the newer ones. im not a whale. by the time i completed building my characters they no longer at par with the current 12th floor spiral abyss. after 2 years im quitting the game. tq btw\n",
      "its a very good game i played on my pc theres one problem with mobile that i think is happening only to me i cant login my account on my phone it keeps saying account or password error i put the right email and password but goes again and again reinstalled it a few times but it be going the same end\n",
      "personally think the games fun and very pretty but it gets very repetitive for a while and becomes boring the amount of money you have to spend to just get a guaranteed 5 star is astonishing too. its genuinely a great game but theres many thing hoyoverse has to improve tho.\n",
      "the game is beautiful and the story is amazing but this game has no diversity. the lack of diversity in this game is frustrating they have 4 characters that have tan kinda dark skin and the rest are pale. tell me how we are in an area that takes place in tbe middle east and everyone is pale that doesnt make sense. this game could be perfect if they just added darker characters. we want darker skinned characters your players want more diversity so please hoyoverse add more skin tones\n",
      "genshin impact is the most beautiful game i have ever seen and my father loves it 2 good story quests good gameplay amazing views and landscapes wishing for characters hopefully you win the 50 50 if you see this and rolling for a character . and many other things. definitely recommend \n",
      "game is awesome overall however please make it more optimized for us mobile players. each patch makes it more heavier and more laggier i do wish the team can do something about optimizing the game a bit. keep up the great work hoyoverse \n",
      "its very fun and i do reccomend it there are bugs here and there but overall its great good story line great quality and amazing character design but all i need is good luck in the wishing part.\n",
      "i downloaded and played this app and im really satisfied but when i deleted and installed it again i cant even even update and log in theres nothing wrong with my wifi or data i really want to play it again with my siblings so can you fix the problem i really like this game.\n",
      "extremely great game ive been playing it for a year everyday. ive also spent a lot on this game 500 and would like to continue seeing great contents from this game. however as a south asian person hoyoverse has proved to me that they are racist anti black as they represented the whole of south asia with close to none numbers of black characters except one upcoming mercenery depicting and enhancing one of the biggest problem of middle eastern south asian problem skin tone discrimination\n",
      "great game the game has beautiful world and great design characters. but it has a lot of bugs and theres very less things u can do at the end game. also i would not recommend spending money to get characters cuz theyre stupidly expensive and not worth invest ur all savings in it.\n",
      "please fix the bug where if you use certain characters bursts the enemys hp bar will immediately vanish this is also the case when using gaze of the deep in fischls domain riding a waverider and getting hit with dirt by the treasure hoarder who uses a shovel to attack. i also cannot see grass damage text ice and water keeps giving me flashbangs. hoping to see this fixed soon.\n",
      "very good on mobile but only one complaint. whenever i play for too long my phone lags a lot and sometimes if i battle enemies my phone lags harder but other than that amazing game very nice community too except for some people.. but still cant wait for future updates \n",
      "i really like this game but i wish theyd listen to the people playing it more. ive been playing this game for more then a year now but we still havent really progressed into the story sure there are events and all but it gets a little boring when youve been playing it for a long time. the game is starting to get interesting though so ill just wait but yeah.\n",
      "its okay so far but why is there no controller support or a setting to move change buttons and their sizes these massive buttons really get in the way of panning the camera.\n",
      "this is the best game ive ever played. amazing graphics music and content. thank you so much for this....update the new game update is awesome..the game and the music are absolutely amazing\n",
      "this game is great. but still for your own sanity dont download this its developer dont care about your opinions suggestions other problem of this game exist even after 2 years and they are some major ones in game rewards are miniscule if you are f2p you need to save 4 5 months to get good character its expensive as crazy to get one 5 charector with all constellation you need to spend currency worth of 1000 1100 persons 1 time food in india check youtube for problems b4 downloading\n",
      "i have been playing this game for almost an year and i cant stop playing the lore is amazing farming for characters was a little hard at the begging but now its amazing amazing graphics and amazing characters. if u dowload this game i hope u will enjoy it like i did\n",
      "ive been playing this game for two weeks and i cant get enough of it. i definitely recommend this game to those who wanted to play alone and explore a place like teyvat collect random materials and gather your own food. you can also play with other players if you want to but the system the game wont force you to play with them. do what you wanted to do. complete the given tasks defeat the enemies and earn moras and primogems.\n",
      "i love this game very much and every day i play it on the ipad and use the controller but when my ipad was damaged i moved to my phone which is samsung i couldnt connect the controller because my phone is samsung and now i am very upset please put an update we can use the controlerl and the keyboard on all devices \n",
      "my phone keeps heating up just by downloading the resources but ill see if it really is worth playing. edit its so cool but my phone really wants a middle conn. area and the fps drop is so hard sometimes it kicks me out of the game.\n",
      "so good at the start for about the first 5 minutes. as soon as the dragon appears my whole screen is covered. then when i have to fight the dragon im confused because the dragon was really glitchy so i couldnt fight it. i couldnt find where the actual dragon was. update fixed\n",
      "never have i ever fallen in love this much with a game. i just started playing im still so confused but i know ill get it eventually. its been a long time since i felt something weird yet wholesom yes i get butterflies in my stomach which is really weird thank you for creating a game where theres co op love that feature. looking forward for more.\n",
      "its not that good im sure it can be but it took me three hours to get past the loading screens and after the loading screens was a white screen with some words and a laggy voice 20 minutes later the laggy voice is gone but the screen stays white cant even use the damn game.\n",
      "ive been playing for almost 3 years and hoyoverse never seize to surprise me in every version im literally amaze on how much effort the developers put in to the stories animations and characters. i seriously appreciate you guys for creating the best amazing and most fun game of all times \n",
      "whoever is behind the character designs and storyline needs to be fired lmao. theres so much undercover and blatantly obvious racism taking place with the lack of diversity with characters and the storyline which glorifies colonization this game would be so much better if they just properly represented the cultures theyre profiting off of and maybe widened the range of skintones used but apparently they cant do that\n",
      "when you think a game cant get any better. the general public seems to only see genshin as that botw ripoff or just another gacha game but seriously thats just another business model nowadays and ive gone on for months without giving the game direct money the story of this game can stand on its own the battles are flawless except for spectres and all in all a solid game sumeru update lets gooo \n",
      "as beautiful as it is it has horrible race diversity. a lot of orientalism and flat out horrible. besides that the game is beautiful. however i wish they would add more skin tones and let us have darker characters. sumerus characters were a big disappointment in this area.\n",
      "pretty good game and honestly one of the best gacha style rpgs ive ever played. i really enjoy the art style and characters. the development could use a little work but is overshadowed by how beautiful this game is. 5 across the board.\n",
      "update i am now playing genshin on mobile and still standby to say that this game has honestly been one of the best ones that came out for me during the 2020 pandemic and now that sumeru is out there are way more things to explore and plus a new element added to the game the open world gameplay is still absolutely phenomenal.\n",
      "okay so i have been playing genshin since it was first released. i would rate this higher but i dont play it on android anymore due not having controller support. other then that the game is awesome. also still waiting on the nintendo switch port.\n",
      "this is a great game i absolutely love it the graphics are beautiful the gameplay is great and its just overall wonderful. i definitely recommend it if you are a mature age. there is mention of alchohol and you gotta fight enemies but thats why it has an age recommendation. very fun 12 10\n",
      "i love genshin but im giving it 4 stars because i love the elemental bursts of the five stars and there is a bug that just leaves the animations to look like 4 star animations. it only did this after sumeru so could pls fix that if it gets fixed ill up the stars ig\n",
      "this is literally so fun i ould play it all day every day if i could the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is bc the lack of instructions it doesnt really tell you how to unlock new characters or anything like that so it could be confusing for new players but other then that i definitely recommend\n",
      "i really enjoyed playing gi however all the gems that you need to buy a hero is a very expensive also you only get 2 or 1 primogens each time. requesting to have it more primogens each mission to make it balance since there also skins for heroes so might as well for some players who wanted to use those skin will need to recharge.\n",
      "i really like this game to anyone who read this im being serious on giving genshin rating. this game is pure f2p you can play without spending any money and still get 5 star the storyline graphic gameplay and gacha system are all really nice and good. especially the storyline are epic and you can enjoy it for free the size of this game was big but it was worth it and there are many region you can unlocked and explore in this game so you wont get bored.\n",
      "the 3.0 update is causing some sort of gameplay lag not ping . idk if its only happening to me or others too. i am playing on a sd 870 device on low graphics but 45fps and its still lagging not ping . devs please fix it. want to explore sumeru. n thanks devs for this awesome game. sumeru is breathtaking.\n",
      "this game is really cool its nice its fun story is nice too but theres a quest where you have to kill some enemies obviously but im underleveled for the quest so i have to get stuff to ascend my characters however i cant get stuff without friends to help and the co op feature is locked while the quest is happening and the quest goes on until completed.again i cant complete the quest.cannot get past it. i cannot progress...at all.i am stuck forever. lower the difficulty\n",
      "its amazing its fun the gameplay is amazing the lore etc. i cant give it 5 5 stars tho because of the characters i wish some of them would be darker skinned and have appropriate skin tone when it has an obvious cultural clothing\n",
      "tye game doesnt support the mobile users and the flaws im about to say no matter how good the game is it make trash instantly a world 1 using teleport way points take much time 2 teleporting to the 3 main cities couse fps drop and lag even in the lowest graphics settings b the abyss 1 it take from 7 to 12 sec for the monsters to appear 2 delay on counting the damage wast alot of time and wast skills for nothing 3 fps drop when casting heros skill some times not enough space .....\n",
      "i like the game its awful on mobile. super laggy on bigger screens in general. when i play on my tablet it looks really fuzzy but i cant turn up the graphics cuz as soon as i move my character it lags. i had to do a captcha to play but it was way too precise if i was a few pixels off it failed. it also didnt accept when i entered the code i got from my email saying the code was invalid or something i checked multiple times it was entered correctly . i cant exit for a second w o it closing.\n",
      "everything about this game including the graphics music and storyline is fantastic. you become anxious about solving puzzles though rather than enjoying the game. because you only receive common chests after solving a difficult puzzle the events are becoming repetitive. for the love of god hoyoverse pay attention to what the community is saying. inazuma and the new golden apple archipelago event are giving me a headache. its just not fair for us f2p players but i still recommend this\n",
      "why is there still no android controller support every other platform has it for well over a year. still a good game but please listen to what we all want after finishing content there are long periods where you basically just do nothing except level up characters and be locked by resin daily resource cap . with other rivals like tower of fantasy i hope it creates good competition for us all.\n",
      "its a beautiful game extremely addictive too may i add one. endless so far amount of quests i would totally recommend it does take up a lot of space but its so worth it \n",
      "i enjoy the game but the fact that there is no grass text dmg and ice bridge showing just ruins the whole expirience and the fun there are a lot of players that quit the game beacuse of it please fix the problem i need to know if my characters are good enough and i want a nice experience in this game\n",
      "they still dont listen to your complaints and they are very out of touch the game is beautiful and could be better but they dont really fix any big issues character move descriptions dont match what they are supposed to and if you want a guaranteed shot at a character get ready to spend around 200\n",
      "the game is heavily pay to win but it has many other nice features to compensate. however there is one incredible stupid thing that ruined the game for me. its a quest trial of smth that you may occasionally get without any warning and which lock the coop for you until finished. the quest itself is incredible hard and i believe impossible to finish without investing tons of cash into the game or be extremely lucky in gacha rolls for specific characters .\n",
      "the game fell off after the past year. the events leading up to inazuma were not very good and all hope was that inazuma was going to be good but unfortunately it was a flop the devs focus entirely on selling their characters through their lore and at every opportunity try to intertwine it with events and such which leaves little time for actual fun. the rewards from events are mostly poor and dont provide enough in terms of level and skill materials from complex said event quests or domains.\n",
      "the game is good but genshin should do better with the character designs and lack of diversity or good representation on the playable characters. like really make the enemys dark skinned and the playable chara white as possible \n",
      "one of the best game so far. i play this game for 10 months its still the best and fun events i like the mechanics storyline playstyle gacha characters and more. i would say this is the best game for me and im glad they created this beautiful game. thank you hoyoverse.\n",
      "no character power balancing or changing at all character weak weak forever strong strong until stronger character and game missing easiest qols changes like claim all button and similar. co op is so limited to the point that it is boring and not rewarding you cant even do some dailies together . resin and gacha is bad as always. but still game is free can be cleared with weakest characters and slowy improving so if you have storage you can try it\n",
      "id really want to give it 5 s but the amount of grinding is that much which makes player to quit since from day 1 ive been doing nothing but grinding. the cycle of grinding and suffering doesnt end it goes hand in hand. at first grinding was fun for like 1 or 2 yrs but long one can do grinding with petty rewards also. atleast increase the amount of primogems from spiral abyss or events or lower the pity which makes player to continue the game in a fun way instead of doing grinding only.\n",
      "hi. ive been playing for half a month now. its such a fun ride. i met a lot of friends bond with my younger sister and even found peace in the game. it has lots of events that were exciting and has lots of lores. but my most favorite part is the teapot where i can design it whatever i want. too bad i got hacked. i guess its time for me to quit for now. thank you genshin impact \n",
      "very entertaining and one of the best i played so far. highly recommended but heres some key factors to point out items from the chest are flying all over have to be manually picked up every time except in the domains. i find this annoying. low mora rewards but upgrades are very expensive in terms of mora requirements aside from the other prerequisite items to upgrade certain characters and weapons. low reward item drop rate even in bosses and difficult tasks events.\n",
      "unfortunately i cant even start this game because of the verification code that should be sent to either my account email address or phone number. the verification code doesnt arrive to the mailbox or mobile phone even though when i try to log into hoyolab account or genshin impact account from my pc there are no issues with the delivery of the verification code\n",
      "the game is good the open world the characters the music and the combat is smooth but the endgame contents are really lacking i hope you guys add some permanent endgame contents. windtrace would be good as a permanent endgame content.\n",
      "the sheer amount of grinding that you have to do if you want any semblance of a new character is just maddening. if you dont want to spend weeks trying to to scrape together enough primogems to get a chance at a low tier 5 star that still gets out classed by someone new that comes out 5 days later you can always spend 200 dollars...for one not guaranteed to be who youre trying to get character. just make the character system reasonable and the micro transactions justifiable for gods sake.\n",
      "i have been playing this game for so long i started playing in 1.6. if you are not prepared to grind dont play. i had to buy gems once in a while and the money is defenitely not worth the amount of genisis crystals given. the anniversary gifts are not very fair and banners dont stay up for long so if you dont buy and to get enough primogems you would haved to grind for around 3 months prior even more to about a 30 win. if they were a bit more generous with primogems i would play more.\n",
      "game is superb and fun to play. however the response from support is slow and frustating. ive been trying to contact support due to a problem with my account as its already past its due date of the promise date. at the very least give me an update.\n",
      "this game is really great but i wish it would be optimized for low end devices for a smoother gameplay because my phone is not high end but also not a low end phone but i can only play on medium graphics because my phone cant take higher than that so i wish you guys would hear me out but overall this game is amazing\n",
      "i saw an ad for the game and thought hey this seems nice lemme download it so i do and after regsitering on a new chromebook that i got a few months ago i was excited to see what it was all about but as soon as i try to begin a message pooped up on my screen saying insuffcient storage space. please ensure sufficient space and try again but i have enought space for the game to do its downloading. which means this game is a total waste of time to anyone who wants to actually play the game\n",
      "i love this game the only thing i hate is quest why is it so long like wasting all my time doing it specially this 3.0. i love puzzle events and exploration but quest give it short or an option to skip. i give it 5 star because i love the scenery so much \n",
      "horrid. ive been playing this game for almost a year recently i spent around 300 on different packags and ever since that purchase the app wont open properly im freeted eith a black screen then a white one with the hoyoverse logo and then just white ive waited for hours for it to load fast and nothings working ive restarted my phone shut it down everything.\n",
      "everything about this game is really good the plot the story line as well as the characters which make more awesome....for us players in the summon event it will be a bit better if we can summon 5 star in 50 to 60 pulls because some of us players are so bad and when we try to collect promo the event is already over by the time the promo reaches....which is a bit sad....but other than that its the best game for me......\n",
      "not much to say about it aside from it being an amazing game goo i mean perfect quality and a great adventuring. the character list is so exciting to watch thus leveling up your characters and party. the game even lets you explore the free space of this wanderland fight enemies to unlock treasure and even has that good vibe. the bgm is relaxing and sky changes are beautiful. its worth the space on my phone it took really\n",
      "this game is fun and i like it very much but i dont like how u cant get it on certain devices. this game should be compatable with other devices instead of just certain devices and ik u guys are prob working on things to make this game more compatable with other devices. but still it should be open on other devices.\n",
      "ok i dont know how to reach you guys right now. but the game is being buggy since today. crafting bench crafting button wont work. teleport button wont work. i cant switch characters switching button wont work. game is freezing. just wanted to let you guys know. im playing on galaxy s22 \n",
      "lack of endgame and permanent repeatable content outside grinding monsters in overworld which isnt rewarding and on top of that daily caps are fairly annoying in some cases. i can literally blindly pick 4 characters from my entire roster and do abyss with ease. events are mostly pointless. add more world levels a overworld is laughably easy and maybe something like infinite abyss or any honkai endgame maybe some social aspects such as guilds with a common goals to achieve etc.\n",
      "lot of changes have occurred over the course of time. i still do not encourage playing this game if youre swayed by gambling or microtransactions. for those who have that self control the game is fun and they are improving the quality of the game itself.\n",
      "this is a very good game with nice graphics but it has so much glitch in mobile version like when you go fight stormterror the screen glitch so much and the screen turns black and blue how can we beat the boss without seeing it.\n",
      "i really enjoy playing this game but im kinda worried for its story about aether and lumine. its just that it might continue for a really really long time this game is already 2 years..but the story just started. i really wanna see its ending. but im sure that by the time developers finish this game most of the old players would be already tired of playing it. for example me im on rank 55 still i appreciate your efforts i hope soon after your game will be finished.wish you best luck \n",
      "exceptional. im surprised and excited by the sheer amount of detail and plot in this game. the stories are so thought out and so much to discover. cute characters and beautiful game play.\n",
      "this game is beautiful its so detailed. i love how it has these wonderful stones to level up ur characters. its just wonderful how you can defend urself by these awesome weapons too.the only reason why i gave it a four star is because the prices. its so expensive thats why i always give my work credit.anyways great game 3\n",
      "this game is one of the best rpg games in mu opinion the story is awesome and the gameplay is easy and fun but the problem is the gacha system this system isnt fair for example getting charchters and weapons not all the people can get them and this is so annoying especially for f2p players . all this in my opinion and i hope you all will understand that \n",
      "just started 2 days ago but i adore the game and its atmosphere. also the options on where to go and the graphics along with the atmosphere are amazing. this game is truly amazing and perfect\n",
      "this game is definitely one of the gems of the gaming community as a whole. my only request is the ability to play story and archon quests again. i was wondering if this could be implemented due to the fact that the main quests are just so enjoyable \n",
      "the artifact system is too much genshin. farming and leveling up artifacts is just too much rng but i found a solution you either make players choose the main stat and sub stats that they can get in an artifact and it works like a pity system when you play multiple times you are guaranteed or have a chance to get that artifact with said stats or make every single artifact craftable for every 3 artifacts. you dont have to listen to me genshin you can find your own solution just make it better\n",
      "this is a really good game its has a good graphics nice music good character big open world and have a fun journey to do...but to get the character that we want is kinda hard for free to play like us so mihoyo if u read this can u give us more primo on the daily quests pls 10primo is kinda small amount if u can give us 15primo on the daily quests its going to be way better we really need the primo so if u give us what we want we will really appreciate it tq 3\n",
      "love this game the environment and its accompanying music is just the most beautiful thing ever and the combat is super fun. totally f2p too ive not spent a single dime and i have 6 5 characters and 3 5 weapons. could have way more im just saving for reruns a lot of characters repeat an element and weapon combo though. id like to see more unique characters both design and gameplay wise \n",
      "while some aspects of the game is great such as the gameplay story soundtrack characters and etc the resin system needs some fixing. i really think this is a needed fix because of how many domains that have been added to the game. a shorter cooldown on resin regeneration could probably solve it. 6 minutes would probably be enough.\n",
      "im a new player and ive been having a fantastic time with this game. gameplay and graphics are topnotch ive set the graphics to balanced and it runs pretty smooth the one problem is that liyue just doesnt seem to ever load properly unlike mondstat everytime i got to liyue everything just starts looking wrong for a while until it loads in then i leave and return and the process repeats. mondstat never had this problem.\n",
      "this game is perfect and really good but the problem is that whenever the log in window comes and i put the exact same google account the game goes from the very start can you tell me why this happens even though i did put the same account.\n",
      "version 2.4 straight up garbage server ruined my experience soo bad that i dont think i will continue playing this thing cant even say game anymore cause games are supposed to be fun playing but this thing makes me soo much frustrated ive no word to describe this experience 3 30 2022 ping controllable now 200 500 lags are reduced game feels a lil smooth now and loving the new events.\n",
      "this is a great game with so much content. my only negative is i cant invert the camera y axis using touchscreen. please include this as an option \n",
      "remember remember 2nd anniversary is coming this will be a pylon for for 29th of september so that no one will forget what happened last year. you made your 1st anni memorable notoriously it was. the game has become stale for older players and something needs to change. starting off with treating anni like one is a great step forward acknowledging that the game needs to step up to its fanbase feedback and demand. i really hope this is the first and last review bomb there will ever be...\n",
      "the gameplay is fun sure. but it is hard to get the amount of rewards you would need to get your favorite character without having to pay. the game is also not very mobile friendly which bothers me so much since i am unable to play this game on my laptop. not to mention there are very little characters that have dark skin which i hate. this game needs more diversity. thats all i have to say for now.\n",
      "it is very a detailed game and also the characters designs are flawless. although it takes so much space especially for mobile players and thats the only problem im having. i do recommend this game tho\n",
      "its the best game ive ever ever played but only one problem...it lags a lot. like sometimes the sound glitch and everything becomes blaack. fix it pls. now its all good but another problem. why is the storage sooo mucchhhh \n",
      "been playing this game for almost 2 years its a great game but it has a lot of cons. the sumeru update just released and the story already feels rushed and it doesnt stick to its plot or main theme. sumerus archon is actually terrible and her personality is cringe too. since sumeru is based off of arab egyptian and indian culture i feel like the archon shouldnt be a literal glow stick. there is a lack of representation for tan brown and dark skin people of color in their own region.\n",
      "the new update is soo good also this game have really big improvement the cutscenes are smooth and not laggy like before the characters are pretty cool too and i love how they add new designs of the ncps i also love the scenery of the new region sumeru. also please fix the water i cant see the ice when i use any cryo character anyways ill be waiting for more awesome updates like this.\n",
      "the game is awesome its well polished cutscenes and everything else is very well done the characters storyline lore is great the open world is beautiful but i would like to say you should optimize the game for mediatek devices one more thing is that the game heats up my device alot i tired every device with good requirements so that the game could run smooth but still some lag and my device heats up alot there is not much content for endgame players and plz give characters more teapot voicelines\n",
      "good game but for amount of space it takes up the fps should be stable and there should be controller support. also the resin system cap slows progression to a crawl.\n",
      "very good game to play but missing lots of qol improvements. e.g. remote support on android devices resin cap etc. this causes a big disparity in game enjoyment across different devices and produces unfair advantages.\n",
      "the best game ive ever seen good graphics and i kinda have a problem with it its not a problem of me but others some phone cant see atk damage grass and ice and its buggy to other phones like potato phones so please fix it i feel bad for the person having problems with genshin impact they cant ice bridge anymore seeing ice so hoyo please fix it it cost alot of storage so some people actually do have problems with it definitely peoples with 34gb mihoyo fix it please i beg you bye mohuyo d\n",
      "good great and i very enjoyed playing this game but i am sooooo unlucky i only have 2 5stars characters sbut it is alright as long as this game continue being such a good game i recommend this game to everyone it has lots of positive things like good graphics good story line great animation and lots of fun and compliment tasks to do. thanks for making this game and i hope to continue developing this game . my thanks \n",
      "i really like this game because of the graphics and because of the story sure sometimes its a little laggy but just tweak the settings a little bit and the lag will be gone also theres always so.ething new to be excited about\n",
      "this new event is bad. a lot of just reused stuff. they put way too much thought into puzzles. they think its clever but its just very annoying. story is mostly boring. sad origins stories arent automatically interesting guys. please be better.\n",
      "i really2 love this game and so i bought a new phone to have greater experience so the problem is.... i bought samsung galaxy a13 but when i installed genshin it said that its incompatible... pls fix this problem if possible i really want to play it.... ill change my ratting if this problem is fixed..... thank you\n",
      "i really like the story line the characters design and backstory i love the open world to explore where you can do loads of things but sadly it uses way to much storage. the pity and gacha sistem could be a lot better some elemental reactions are a bit too plain like swirl and cristalize. quite sad that its only till ar 60 hopefully in the future therell be more.\n",
      "overall is nice.. only in anniversary i have some a suggestions but not this coming anniversary.. maybe other year when it time comes create some special event and special story quest just only design for anniversary . like special event boss or maybe super exciting quest or challenges i dont care about the rewards.. but only your decision what the best. thats all \n",
      "while the game itself is incredible and enjoyable the only thing i would like more is controller support on an android device. besides that this game doesnt have any major flaws from what ive seen .\n",
      "before its release i was thinking about an open world anime ish game would be amazing and its like the outer gods heard me and gave us genshin impact since the release ive been playing it a lot my son plays it too the lore and the characters are great. the events are cool too some miss and some are fun but thats okay.\n",
      "i play this game since 1.6 update but i cannot play it because it keep showing network error although my internet is normal speed. i recently send an email to your department to fix my problem but they havent respond anything until now. i spend a lot of money in genshin and it really dissapoint me right now. i need you to fix this as soon as possible.\n",
      "this game is insanely relaxing but i have some issues when i am using a data network the game is continuously reconnecting it bothers me because i rarely use my data network when im working and add the resin capacity and late game stuff.\n",
      "this has got to be the best free to play game ive played so far. im an f2p player and seeing as to how hoyoverse has grown generous these days deserves a 5 star from me. although i wish they could do something about the 50 50 system on their gacha since f2p players like me has to grind twice as hard just to get the character i want. then again i dont spend money on this game so still enjoyable. \n",
      "genshin impact is for me the best game so far since v1.0 year 2020. this game is one of the things that helps me to get through from the pandemic of 2020. idgaf for those players who gives low ratings to genshin impact because of the anniversary rewards. it didnt became the best game of 2020 because of nothing but the real players who really appreciated and committed to the game. i will support genshin impact and continue to play and unveil the whole story of the game no matter what.\n",
      "very nice game with awesome graphics and a complicated plot in a good way . very smooth and solid experience. good job developers \n",
      "this is one of the worst games i have ever played. after playing for a couple of hours it has not done anything to hook me in wether it was the barebones story. boring and bland combat. and the amount of mindless grinding i had to do just to level up and continue playing the game. dont waste your time with this game especially if you plan on spending money for a character. buy an actual game instead.\n",
      "been playing this game for a year. graphics soundtrack characters gameplay is excellent and i love all of it. the only reason i couldnt give more than 3 stars is due to the lack of end game content. spiral abyss is the only end game content which refreshes 2 weeks after and finished in an hour to 2. then youre back to artifacts grinding mats grinding which is capped by the resin limit. for small spender you basically login for 30 mins and youre done with everything you need to.\n",
      "i had issues logging back in to my game daily and this game is clearly not suited for f2p players. also this is basically a breath of the wild knock off. i genuinely have no idea how they get away with these things. wouldnt let me give 0 stars. the actual 5 go to breath of the wild .\n",
      "this game is a generally good app theres a lot i like about it. however when i try to login to my account via google im doesnt let me.ive been trying for a few days now it just says network error but my wifi is fine. is there anyway i can fix this \n",
      " edited just updated and theres a white screen flickerinf before the door opening cutscene begins. i almost had a seizure ar 58 loyal player and i have to say i am disappointed edit reinstalled maybe it installed wrong and it works perfectly fine now 3\n",
      "this is the most frustrating game on moblie there are so many bugs health doesnt exist and leveling is impossible. you cant even progress unless your 10 levels above what you already are. game developers you should be called out because this is the worst game i have ever played\n",
      "adventure at first is fun but once u r done with the stories and exploring and just waiting for new region update game is hell. constant battle with rng for artifacts that will take months to get. the rate of certain sub stat and main stat is extremely unbalanced making it near impossible to get a dream artifact. even takes months of farming just to get a head piece with crit dmg main with decent sub stats. they have regular events but a lot of them feels like filler events thats just there.\n",
      "it is a good game but most of the time it starts to glitch and i cant see the game properly. so it gets hard to defeat enemies since i cant see where they are\n",
      "its such a beautiful game i really enjoyed. but what is making me rating it just 4 stars is because of this problem... ive deleted it once but when i tried installing it again it says that there isnt enough space knowing that i have 128gb and 66gb are free...\n",
      "overall love the new update the graphics and new characters. the reason im giving it a three star is because when i fight monsters i cant see there hp which is troubling. at first i was just ignoring it but now i need you to fix it please asap. thank you.\n",
      "the reason why i give it one star is because its not compatible with a ps5 dual sense controller now developers i would gladly appreciate it if you would have update so the controller can work flawlessly with the game it a wonderful game it really shames me to say this. developers again please update the controller support for ps5 controllers. now i have to uninstall the game because it makes no sense having a game that i cant use a controller it defeat of purpose of having a controller.\n",
      "really fun beautiful game the gacha is not necessary to progress but can be improved greatly. main complaint give users more primogems as we level up our adventure rank its only natural to reward more to those who fight harder bosses so why is this not implemented in genshin another would be the way banners work. the standard event banner is not going to be enough soon banners can be seperated by element or weapon class of the characters to make things easier on the player \n",
      "whenever i try to top up it keeps saying to top up using the device i registered my account on. i havent found a way to bypass this. i dont have the device i registered my account with and this just seems super unnecessary and incredibly annoying. please remove this feature.\n",
      "i have a 64 gig sim card that the game wont download to so i cant even get past the secondary download. can you fix this. ive been playing on playstation 4 and did the account i have the app and i wanted to be able to play on my phone too. i am intending on dumping allot of time into this game. please fix. i transfered the app to the sim and it still is trying to download to my phone.\n",
      "good game but its size who haves wifi can download it but who have cellular network they get problems..and android users problem is when tey put a little bit highsetting the phone gets overheated.. by the way games is very very interesting and good\n",
      "the music is fantastic and a lot of effort was put into the overarching storyline. theres some issues with too much pandering but its a great game. just keep your wits and dont go on a primogem spending free for every character you see as a casual player i whole heartedly recommend this game\n",
      "ight so this game is good the graphics r nice its fun to play its engaging and the story is awsome. one thing that bothers me so much is the rng in this game. im an f2p and for the grinding i do the amount of primos i get is not rewarding at all. not to mention the fact that i lost my 50 50 during ittos rerun to a char i hate so much jean. and then i got her again from standard as if gettin her on limited wasnt enough. seriously u guys need to fix the rng in this game its so stupid.\n",
      "this game is actually fun to play exciting story wonderful world and a lot of fun stuff but sometimes the game suddenly crash for no reason mostly when im in commision or story. please fix that issue\n",
      " challenges are difficult for me hope its easier. im stuck. still slow and there some glitch too. 5 character are hard to get. ive been getting some characters too many times. ugggh.\n",
      "the game itself is very enjoyable graphics are nice storyline is interesting characters are well designed. i like how the glitch on dvalin signora and yunjn are now fixed. though there is one problem the dmg numbers plus the grass some devices cant handle it this also includes my device it would be great to have like an option where you could turn the grass and or the dmg numbers in the settings. i do hope this problem will be soon fixed in the future.\n",
      "im going to give this game a 3 stars until genshin fix the hard and irritating puzzles its too hard to solve and its really irritating and it ruined the fun. can genshin please make the puzzles eazier to solve but besides the puzzle everything is pretty good.\n",
      "this game is incredibly thought out and ive spent hours playing it. beautiful music amazing graphics and overall enjoyable experience. the characters and lore is well developed and engaging and completely immersed with the environment. only complaint i would have is the lack of end game content.\n",
      "i manage to go through dvalin texture glitch with my own ways but the problem is when i got kazuha i use his elemental burst and elemental skill the enemys health bar dissapeared like an error even when i had kujou sara the enemy life bar disappears after using her burst at them it was very difficult for me not knowing if they are losing their life or still at a half life please hoyoverse fix this error immediately \n",
      "great game really addicting i dont like how i keep losing the 50 50s great characters and designs especially xiao the notifications unfortunately do not work for me which means it will not tell me when my resin is full. some bugs but all fine \n",
      "honestly so colorful beautiful detailed . i love the graphics voices and character abilities. only wish there were more diversity and less whitewashed but oh well\n",
      "pros lots of characters to meet lore to discover areas to explore story to read. cons the endgame. holy bleep the endgame is a grindy rng fest. its hard to get excited for a new character when itll take 12 hours just to get them to a usable state. artifacts are rng ception and hoyoverse has declined to put in any of the quality of life elements from honkai impact that made the rng for stigma less painful. you cant skip the domains either. the headache is real.\n",
      "25 seconds to check email to get verification code and then if your on mobile like i am you have to open a second window and when you do the game crashes completely out starting the whole process over again. it takes longer than 25 seconds for my freaking browser to load my sign in for my email this is absolutely stupid and unnecessary uninstalled.\n",
      "hello hoyoverse i would like to reach out my complaint with the log in issue as you could see when i log in to my account it always informs me that there was an error even tho its the correct account and password also when i logged in my account it made me start from the very beginning and made me have a different uid than the original one i have i hope you can fix it and i would really appreciate it to be able to catch up with the on going event thank you very much \n",
      "im a regular pc user and the game is just fantastic. amazing visuals smooth story and overall great experience playing it if youre not a big anime fan this game is not for you.\n",
      "dear travelers good day night to you all thank you for playing genshin impact till this day i know i know the anniversary rewards kinda sucks but that doesnt mean we have to bad mouth the company mihoyo genshin impact thank you for making this game this game is really fun ive been playing it since launch it has been hard and sometimes painful but still hanging in there because the game is really fun making your characters stronger farming for mats its fun especially in coop ty \n",
      "the music and art are 10 10 but the lack of endgame content and communication between mihoyo and players is shockingly bad. they have been getting more and more greedy ignore our requests to fix the resin cap or the resin recharge rate and there have been many unfulfilled promises to us. we want to recieve road maps and updates on what is planned for the future its really disappointing that a game with such immense potential is let down by the marketing team and customer support.\n",
      "my account created since game launch my friend created two accounts recently and get character very easy in 10 40 pull for both new accounts. for me i need 80 pull each time and sometimes come out other character. i really wanna quit already. pay more for nothing compared to new accounts which dint pay any. now my friend character all stonger than me. wanna cry\n",
      "holy freaking download as much as i would love to play this game the download is insane. ok ive finally made enough space to download game and will change rating after ive had a chance to play a bit. uninstalling. i logged in only to find yet another download. its just too much\n",
      "the latest 2.8 update has some great story content and puzzles the only real thing missing from the game is some permanent rewarding and repeatable content ... shocker p\n",
      "this game is definitely one of the best ive seen for a f2p mobile game. other than the fact that alot of good characters and items are locked behind real money if you miss them its an alright game. would probably recommend.\n",
      "great game. however too much addiction on it. better be careful spend time too. graphics quality great but overheating are main issue. maybe because too many rendering 3d details hidden.\n",
      "game is fun and easy to understand currently ar 35 and no major issues. i like the gacha and the characters are really cool. would recommend to people who love casual combat games. can play on ps4 mobile pc and switch\n",
      "well i cant really make an experience when i cant even play the game because of inefficient storage and the game looks nice from other prospectives but like how much storage does this game need cause i cant play it\n",
      "game is great but im so sick of those dialogs and cut scenes. guys every single quest has tons yes tons of dialogs nonsense dialogs repeat animations stupid choices that has no meaning. put a skip option please it became really annoying and frustrating to skip those stupid dialogs one by one. this waste too much time i dont think i can take it anymore..\n",
      "facing a lot of bugs and glitch issues after 2.8 update. i reinstalled this game for two times in this two weeks. totally disappointed. my game got stucking. why is happening after 2.8 update. stupid developers fix the lag issues.\n",
      "dont get me wrong i love genshin everything is beautiful but the not enough storage is getting annoying ive deleted most of my games and all my photos to play it but it never works i even deleted cache from mostly everything and ive deleted almost all storage from almost all my games too please help \n",
      "a very perfect rpg game in start you might feel a little bored but when you reach ar 16 the game begins intresting only thing that annoyed me was unskipable conversation which are very long and make to wait for too long. but still the game is just awesome \n",
      "ok i know your wondering why im putting 3 stars but ill tell you why. so overall the game is great but sometimes its very annoying like glitches. but the thing that annoys me the most is when i only havent played for one day and suddenly oh you need to download 33.47 mb. no i have only been off the game for one day and you want me to download it when i already did ye so thats the reason why i give it 3 star oh and well you look at that its stuck on 9.04 \n",
      "overall this game is so addictive and fun 2 play but i hope in the future update developer will put some emotion for the characters or little movement while they are having dialogue in story quest so the player will not often skip the dialogue because of the boring static and emotionless conversation.\n",
      "theres no damage text and i cant see any grass at all. i have samsung a12 and its not lagging since i customized the settings but even with the lowest settings i see no damage text and grass.\n",
      "good gameplay and story but greedy company. making anniversary rewards a marketing scheme that is still gacha even if you submit a piece. absolutely abhorrent and the company just seems so out of touch with their fanbase recently. i been playing for a year so ive noticed the gradual descent to greed. will give a better review once problems are rectified.\n",
      "great game takes up 17gb . samsung galaxy s22 ultra can run it well at maximum graphics settings. however the game is huge and so much happens on screen so i highly recommend playing this on playstation 5 instead.\n",
      "keep getting insufficient storage error code. i tried clearing cache and data un and re installing and moving to sd card and nothing worked. im uninstalling the game. if the devs can answer with a fix i will try again.\n",
      "easily hacked game no email sent to email address as confirmation when unliking accounts. hackers can easily change the info. no second authentication system when log in to other decices as confirmation if the player really did log in on the device.\n",
      "the experience is that it is an open world game and also free. ive been playing it for a while and im already addicted.1 of the best things that there is a trial stage and exchange shop. i wish to get yae miko so badly but i failed. im only adventure rank 8 please wish me some luck in her rerun.other than that the game is good \n",
      "the graphic design and stories are perfect. there are even a lot of events so that we dot get bored of it. its also quite addicting. ive been playing for almost a year now and i never get bored of it.\n",
      "i really enjoy this game. i love the cutscenes character designs the story and fighting. but recently the updates have been taking more and more space which gets me worried about my storage....\n",
      "youve gotta be joking right by all means please tell me who in the entire lost galaxy would want to have to dedicate an unholy 15 gb or more of their devices internal memory just for this game this has gotta be the worst case of an app or game being a massive space hog and its inexcusable. i bet this is why the nintendo switch version of the game never happened...they cant figure out how to make it work with such limited space you cant .\n",
      "hello hoyoverse i dont know but my phone has restarted itself two times. please if you can fix it. i love this game very much and itll will he very hard for me to stop playing it since im ar 50. please i beg you fix this issue if you can.\n",
      "great game. a bit too grindy and i cant connect my xbox controller but other than that its a fun game. the graphics are nice and it runs really well on highest settings on my s20.\n",
      "im playing this game sinds 2.0 and i have ar 50. i wanna say that on ar adventure rank 45 60 you have nothing to do. only events and daily comissions. but thats okay. the only thing is this game is only for phones and tablets that have more than 30 gb of free space. i have xiaomi 11 5g and the game is lagging probably 1 time in week. but if you have stronger phone you can play game without any lags. so... hoyoverse thanks for genshin impact. its really a good game \n",
      "if this is the first time youve played this kind of game be prepared to die while climbing swimming flying and my latest discovery dying while in the top of a freezing mountain hahaha there are so many ways to die in this game without fighting monsters. and by the way the account in honkai is connected to genshin and when i reset my honkai it reset my genshin account can you pls put a warning before the deletion that it will not just reset honkai it will also reset genshin......\n",
      "this is a huge app storage wise takes forever to load just to load something else next. as soon as it was done it asked to log in again to update the app i had just done that all this while not even know what this game was. the ad didnt show the game play or goal or whatever.\n",
      "game is fun till you hit end game and have nothing to do because youve completed all quests. spiral abyss is not enough for end game. the company is colorist. they took an black woman from history to make a character and whitewashed her. the company lacks communication with its player base regarding any upcoming characters and patches always waiting till last minute to even show anything off. too much world and character lore is hidden in one time only events so new players never see it.\n",
      "i must say if you have the good fortune to get a couple good characters then the game feels better than some of the high end console games. good music. cool combat. great characters and a sublime story.\n",
      "do not start playing this game this is the worst bait and switch game ever. first you start off in this brand new world full of possibilities. the main story is amazing and there is tons of exploration but for whatever reason the developers want to drag this game out for 5 10 years literally google it . so after you finish a small part of the main quest you will be stuck doing side quests and random chores. this game should be called chore impact bc it feels like a chore. dont get sucked in\n",
      "the developer has a very good response and the game is not boring there is always something new in this game. i gave 3 star because i lately i think it is harder for us to get primogems the primogems thar we recieve is less than the last version i hope there is more primogems that we can get.\n",
      "a great game but being an endgame player is the worst in this game. pretty boring in the end and rewards sometimes are not even generous. also the artifact system and resin system needs some major and helpful changes because its really off.\n",
      "i mean... words almost cant describe it you gotta play it to understand what this game is all about. the adventure the music the graphics the detail everything is amazing. theres also a co op mode where 3 of your friends or random people can help play together with you. its just 10 10.\n",
      "my network is good but the game always says connection timed out and sends me back to the starting screen. i restarted my modem and phone cleared the cache logged in and out of my account but i still cant play. this is the first time it has happened to me and i pretty much think its because of the update.\n",
      "totally exceptional. literally one of the best game ive ever played. p.s make sure to have a really desent processor and ram. playing it in low is really degrading. personally i play at high medium settings. the devs are really nice with updates. keep up guys. yoimiya main \n",
      "im a f2p player and im good with the anniversary rewards. at least its a free game all in all this is good. the graphics and characters are awesome. im waiting for my pc so i can play again.\n",
      "excellent open world game. many characters many powers different character different way of their power. graphic is veey smooth and good very detailed graphics.\n",
      "pretty solid game all around except for some issues i cant get around. apple has controller support. why after all this time is there no android controller support also why are my frames locked to 60 on every single perform once these features are added it will be a five star app for sure.\n",
      "terrible character design and refuses to listen to the community most of the time. voice acting storyline everything else is good. but the amount of disrespect on real life cultures is horrendous.\n",
      "please do something about regional cross play i just selected american server and now i regret playing in 300 ping .please is there anyway that i can change to asia that will be awesome its just not only my problem literally most of the players are talking about this in everywhere i look . besides this game is really fun i really enjoy playing it \n",
      "i am a sports game guy football basketball racing hunting never in my life i play rpg or any open world game. this is my first definitely a first love of rpg game. version 3.0 please fix sudden quit on black shark 4. i mean sd870 still a very capable chip.\n",
      "amazing art. nice story so far. fun game play. beautiful world. but the thing that ruins this 5 star. the gacha system will eat your money. beware whales. and its very completion heavy to progress. massive grind. even in earlygame. but again i bow to the artists who design these characters.\n",
      "not gonna lie i play this game daily and its wonderful i love all of the characters and such but the problem is downloading the new sumeru update is such a pain i had to delete alot of apps because of it its not my fault i have very little storage.\n",
      "hello gameplay is good and not have problem but the problem is when you want to get artifact i mean to get artifact with good stat .to get it its kind of difficult and need so much effort to get good stat because that appear is totally luck and when we upgrade the good stat artifact its not sure to get a good stat be increase because it depend to luck too you know how frustrated when get bad stat.we have other thing to grind not only artifact so pls fix rate to get it. thank you.....\n",
      "actually the game is fun to play. for me the 1st anniversary rewards are fine just that i dont see their efforts to celebrate the anniversary with players and there is nothing they give to commemorate the anniversary. although there are many aspects to improve i am willing to give them the time because the game updates frequently as the story has not finish. so toxic actions like complain genshin under other games review need to be stop as the official has give free primo for the incident.\n",
      "the gameplay is amazing and the scenery in this game is breathtaking open world exploration is also good but there are few think which can be improved.\n",
      "the game has stunning visuals and graphics and even gameplay however its the reward system thats terrible players wishing on the weapon banner to get the guaranteed weapon they want will have to spend over 200 wishes. and gaining a wish in general takes time for end game players i feel hoyoverse could be more generous like tof\n",
      "its a good game i really like it but i found the gliding lincese exam to be difficult since it was my first time playing this game so i would recommend other set of controls for the player while gliding to drag the controller up to make the players character move up and down for the same way. and to let go of the controller as a way for the player to go down simply and land in the area.\n",
      "genshin impact is a beautiful game. you can go adventuring with your friends you can explore new areas and unlock new characters. but its very time consuming is the only thing. thats the only reason i dont give this five stars.\n",
      "the game is fun and i absolutely love it but i would love if they added more skin tones cultures and more content after the main event of most updates the update gets boring and we have to wait so long for a good update and its also really repetitive everyday so yea\n",
      "downloaded it went to start the game so it checked for updates and started the download it was downloading for over 24 hours said download complete so i excitedly went to play after hearing great things about it from my friends only to be told i had insufficient storage. very disappointed.\n",
      "its very good game but first child is too good of a fighter for a villian so that is bad and villains should always be not so good and that makes a player that ik likes child and not hate him as they should so i am going to change my 5 star to a 4 bc of that second i love this game but if u r playing a laptop or a pc or any device that has keybaord then it is soo confusing and complicated to memorise and change or make all the keys the things to open stuff but for phones and ipads or tablets u d\n",
      "please add controller support. it doesnt play well with touch controls plus screen gets a little hot the controls get uncomfortable to touch.\n",
      "ive been playing this game for almost 2 years but this is the first time that ive been disappointed i wake up early because the shop is reset to exchange for master less glitter i exchange 5 intertwined and 5 acquiant and of course its 10 in total so i try to pull one at time and when its my last pull i though i will get at least a four star but to my surprise theres no four star but a 3 star weapon.. why is that happening i though you will get at least a four star during every 10th pull\n",
      "this is an awesome game not gonna lie its super engaging and when it comes to the graphics of the game they are literally beautiful but theirs only one things that concerns me and that is when a new update is provided the game size increase by a great margin. i request hoyoverse to please work on patch update sizes for mobile players\n",
      "only played 30 mins so far but impressed with the quality and style of this game. feels like a console game and one that should cost money very breath of the wild feeling only a lot more anime. also impressed this is cross play between mobile consoles and pc update ive become consumed by this game now so much to do in it gameplay is great and exploring is rewarding. great game wether your logging in for few daily quests or story line. wish there was more to do in co op though.\n",
      "omg this is so boring played for like 4 hours waiting for the fun part but all i got was bland story and cringe voicelines with good voice acting. also where are the male characters this is like 98 anime girls. if youre a straight male mobile gamer who emphasizes good graphics over gameplay and have a fetish for anime girls this game is for you\n",
      "in my opinion its probably the best game ever. i usually have a hard time playing games and get bored easily but with genshin impact the story line the side stories the quests the fighting and the animation is truly so amazing. lets not even get started on how great the characters are and how beautifully the cut scenes are made.\n",
      "the lack of diversity is honestly annoying. i adore the game the quests and the characters themselves but the complete utter lack of darker characters in regions where dark skin is more prominent is real disheartening as a blk person\n",
      "the game is amazing and i love it but the download is way way too big as i downloaded the 208mb game from the play store and then i had to wait literally 3 days for the 1gb files download and now the stupid update is 4 flipping gigabytes its a good game but honestly it is stupidly big download sizes. im disappointed \n",
      "been playing for almost two years definitely one of best ive ever played theres improvements to be made for sure with dialogue and listening to players but world and music still incredible regardless\n",
      "definitely the best game for action and adventure lovers however i suggest that you play this game on a pc or tablet because after i got the newer version of this game my phone couldnt take it so i had to delete the game but this game works just fine on a tablet or pc.\n",
      "completely built around spending money to actually play the game and obtain anything. if you dont spend you have to be a teenager with nothing to do for months to even be competitive enough to clear everything.\n",
      "i absolutely love this game. i play genshin every day. even if i dont have a lot to do at ar 59 i will definitely wait for new updates because theyre worth it. i never thought id like the game so much. everything is well made designs story quests. mihoyo added even the smallest details which made the game even better. just be careful with the gacha it can become very addictive \n",
      "the game overall is good. it gives nice player experiences such as quests battles and probably events. the story of the game is amazing. it captures the attention of players meaning that not only the players can visualize what is happening but also feel what these characters are going through. great game great story with that you can learn much more about people just like in the real world. great game overall.\n",
      "i get that ever game just wants you to spend money. and you dont have to spend money. though i have but after spending 200 dollars and still not getting a character is rough. so yes im being petty. also the graphics are great and it can glitch at times.\n",
      "when i updated. i quickly noticed the game runs smoothly and heat up less. i still cant believe mihoyo listened. please keep up the good job. stability should be very important no matter the content brought into the game.\n",
      "well one of the best games ever in terms of how they handle the story. but seriously do we really need to have great ping for every hit every single action in a goddamn solo game i mean i understand if we need that for online interactions but while were doing solo whyy i even got kicked out from the second abyss chamber and had to re start from the beginning.\n",
      "little to no skin color uniqueness. models are getting repetitive as there is only 5... and with 41 characters theres barely any difference between the people in the roster.\n",
      "yasssss the characters are rlly good and the stories and quests are really fun one problem sometimes its really hard to log in to my google account but after a few tries its all good but please fix this minor mistake hehe \n",
      "the game is really fun and the graphics are great but every since the newest update my keeps taking me out of the game.i 100 recommend playing on a tablet or a computer so you can have less lagging and a better gaming experience.\n",
      "its a really fun game and have beautiful characters but sometimes i always switching my character but its always stuck in the same character so i have to restart the game and open it again and i always lost my 50 50s like i cant win a single character and the rumors said there hackers in the game so pls banned those hackers but its a really good game and beautiful storys\n",
      "i absolutely love this game. the graphics the scenery the characters everything. thou it does take quite some space in phone.\n",
      "i returned only because of itto. got qiqi. classics. goodbye. otherwise from graphics to gameplay this game is brilliant. exploration and secrets are very captivating.\n",
      "best friggen anime game ever okay listen this is amazing only if you have a device that can handle the game but i love everything about genshin impact i dont think there will be a single thing that makes me hate the game. i am also waiting for the game to be finneshed because i really wanna see when lumine and aether are reunited again. i still think paimon is evil and if she is that would be the best plot twist and i am waiting to see alice.i also am probably gonna spend a million dollars \n",
      "i absolutely love genshin impact its an amazing game and i would give it five starts but a while ago i went to play it and it logged me out and i tried to log back in but it wouldnt let me and the worst part was i was pretty far along and i payed alot of money on the game for wishes and got characters from that and im unsure why but im trying to log back in again and if i can ill give an update but im very upset that it happened if anyone knows how to fix it please let me know\n",
      "its the best open world game ive played in my life but we want to add new places such as the desert as a main place and new animals or extinct animals and also i hope you will make the flying feature a main feature. thank you\n",
      "the game is fun and the storyline is great. ive been playing for quite a long while now. theres a downside however. the game is always so laggy for me and my pings arent even high i really hope mihoyo can fix this.\n",
      "i downloaded the full 10gb update with the unrealistic hope that they might have added controller support to the android app only to be disappointed for the last time. i cannot fathom why controller support is not available for this platform only. how different can android be from ios or windows honestly \n",
      "i like the game but honestly i feel like the female main character lumine has no screen time. that made me doubt that shes the main protaganist in this game. so i kinda switch to playing tower of fantasy bcuz you can customize the main character. whats better people dont debate about which main character is the real one. whats more the pity system in genshin is not likeable especially the weapon banner. and i think 160 resins are too little since there are many new bosses. so yea.\n",
      "the lack of diversity especially in the face of fans constantly telling hoyoverse thats something they need to address is concerning. i adore this game and the story and i know how much hard work has to go into this game. the heads at hoyoverse are doing everyone who make this game successful devs voice actors translators players a huge disservice by blatantly ignoring the calls for more diverse representation in both playble characters and npcs.\n",
      "i love this game on the laptop but on my phone ive never quite gotten used to it. it is stunning and beautiful. great puzzles and a massive world. good if youve got spare time just better on the pc as it can handle more\n",
      "this seems like such a lively game but theres been an error that doesnt allow me to make an account. ive seen so much about this so i really hope they can fix some error accounts soon \n",
      "the exploration is so boring you can just teleport and sprint i hope there are gadgets for exploration like grappling hook or a mount . im already ar 58 and this game become repetetive give us something new to gameplay mechanics not just new maps and characters\n",
      "i cant buy anythin . . it keeps tellin me to request customer service and all that... why wont the game take my monie . . overall i enjoy the gameplay... really puts you on edge and all that. good game to gain the thrill and sense of adventure plus the plot twists.\n",
      "your game was pretty awesome. graphic wise action wise role playing emotional love drama that everything this game have. i am 32yrs old and in my entire life i have never played such a this kind of game which one is just seems like pc game or console games. great work game developer. heads of to you. i just have only one suggestion that is if u put voice chat in the game like if other players join in your world so they can talk to each other with voice. that is pretty cool for us.\n",
      "almost 2 years of playing this game and the genshin experience is still here. the quality of the world is very detailed and it shows as you explore the open world. the characters are still the main selling point with their top notch jp voice acting. but the developers are still out of touch with their playerbase. top up options are very limited without regular discounts and packages. the layers upon layers of randomness in the artifact farming system is still unnecessary.\n",
      "this game is one of the best open world game . the grafix is really good. the story is also very interesting and who can forget the amazing sound tracks . but be careful this game isnt meant to be played all time . its more towards casual type game . but its a very nice game and i think you should try it.\n",
      "i dont get it how much storage does this game need 2 download the damn loading screen like i have 7.85 gb which should be enough 2 get me in the game like i cant even get into it cuz it keeps saying something about not enough storage i cant even get into the game without it saying that tbh i would not wanna play this if its gonna take up all the storage and no i aint contacting yall cuz of this problem.\n",
      "really great game. i have a blast with my friends. you get to do quests and the main story. i really love games like this. you can roleplay fight and do other cool stuff to \n",
      "ive had a few glitches but they are barely noticeable. this game is incredible with load times. it doesnt take forever to start the fun at all \n",
      "this game really great the map is beautiful. . wish the developer can add gesture like more animation to interact with other player maybe dancing hi five that would be great\n",
      "used to think that this is a better and is starting to regret investing. this game hss onenof the worst pity and rolls because in every rolls youre guaranteed to get def. when will it improve thats why a lot is moving on to another game because of this redundant issue. this game is slowly getting suck. i just hope there will be improvement soon if you dont want to lose players. tower is fantasy is better.\n",
      "great game i love to collect items but i have a problem with the monster called geovishap. if in a closed off area it will throw you into a wall then will go back to the center of the area. i am on mobile but i am bring that up because while trying to do perilous trail i keep getting stuck. that is mostly the only thing that stops me from giving it 5 stars. thank you for listening i will change the review.\n",
      "i love this game i have been playing since hu taos first banner genshin has alot of game play and theres really no end to it. well of course once you get to ar50 there will be less and less things to do. but there is always excitement about whats happening next or whats the next banner going to be i advise you to download it if youre thinking about it. \n",
      "i keep crashing every 5 minutes cant even finish my daily commissions but its overall a great game its just my phone sucks. love the characters especially kazuha and ayaka also its very hard to earn primogems in this game\n",
      "such a awesome game its perfect but sometimes the game gets lag in the cut seen and you can get stuck in a level or quest.\n",
      "love the game hope you add the option to change our traveler later cuz i chose mine by mistake. also an option to delete the story event data which are done etc. too \n",
      "since the beginning of the 3.0 update i cant open the app on my laptop no matter how many times i restart it no matter how many methods i use. its not the memory all my other games work fine. even after installing it via different methods its still just a blank screen. please fix this hoyoverse.\n",
      "i love the game and the story is addictive but the size of the game is too much if we had a option to delete voices from the packs that would be great i will give it 4 stars for now after playing this game more i will give it a 5 star.. \n",
      "i love this game i swear but why everytime i go to play i open the doors and it tells me im timed out when im clearly not. it constantly reloads or kicks me out for no reason. somebody tell me if its just me but this is ridiculous how can you call this a well developed game when all im seeing is bugs \n",
      "i have been playing genshin for so long and my only concern is that you guys keep on bringing modern items into the game when its supposed to be a historical game i like the genre right now but i dont want this game to turn into one of those games who only do hangouts. you guys keep on bringing modern items into the game and it kinda pisses me off to the fact that this was supposed to be a game the modern items dont even fit into the genre anymore. like cmon its really annoying.\n",
      "its fun at first. but its a very flawed game which becomes apparent with time play time. each update the game gets less new returner player friendly. 70 of new content is limited time only 1 4 weeks and usually requires you to be completely caught up on the story adventure lv which is very tedious. the limited time events can contain well made story unique gameplay locations that will likely never return. there are many problems but fomo lmttime content is the worst also no end game. \n",
      "i love this game and all of the characters and been playing ever since it came out. but the reason i will give this a 1 star is because of the representation in the game. the new upcoming characters are supposed to be represented and have more darker skin tones. i feel highly disappointed on how white the characters are and why there arent many darker skinned characters. hoyoverse please make more darker skinned characters\n",
      "i had to delete that game because its been making my phone act crazy. im so sad now because genshin is super fun and now i cant play it anymore. hoyoverse please try to make your game more compatible with mobile devices id really like to play again as soon as possible.\n",
      "amazing attention to detail true rpg fun all without the need to spend one red cent. i mean you can if you want to.. im not gonna lie i played for a minute without spending cash to see what it was like it was great totally fun. then i spent some cash it made some things easier however not enough to me to justify a need to buff with cash. the new update is awesome way to go guys i didnt think it could get better till it did \n",
      "i played this on my friends ps4 its a great game but when i tried to play it on my phone it said something about storage like change to significant storage and i dont know what that means i really want to play so please fix this problem.\n",
      "i started to play genshin impact this year and i cant stop playing it i like this game very much seeing the story having great graphics amazing acting with very sad stories in their past but we can say its a very good app this game deserve a lot to be played by everyone\n",
      "this game is very fun compared to others. unlike other games this game has a lot of lore. even unimportant npcs have background stories which makes the game way more interesting. there is a huge area to explore and the scenery is great. this game includes a lot of small details too. quests are also very captivating. music is great and matches different situations. each character is unique and have cool designs and background stories. downfall is huge storage but its worth it \n",
      "wait for a certain day to get items lootboxes but they are not that bad cool gameplay and all but a super slow progression. yet even when there is nothing to do it still makes me want to keep just walking exploring. i wish the resin system just didnt exist making the game more enjoyable\n",
      "no controller support on android makes this a horrible game to play. onscreen controls are unusable on large devices like tablets without extreme disconfort and block ing screen w your hands. very dissapointing\n",
      "ive played for almost all the way from the beginnings of this game debut. the most fun games to play but be reminded that this game as others rpg games need you to grind for your character to become stronger. that also become problems as the grinding needs a lot of times and some of the materials to level up really get so hard to get. i know this game required player to pay for top notch characters and weapons but make it easier for leveling up so that it became more fun to play.\n",
      "this game is very good and very easy for me to play because it doesnt consume too much of my time. the in game experience is on another level i cant compare it with any game it feels like we are in other world and living the travelers life. just like an anime reincarnation. i really enjoyed this game and still enjoying it. \n",
      "im sorry but for some reason i was doing the chasm quest and then i was on a cutscene and for some reason it kicked me out i restarted it but still not working and im unable to play so help and theres no need for updates and stuff so yeah..... idk if this is a glitch or something but help t t ive also deleted it and redownload it but its still not working\n",
      "its a gacha game never expected it to be f2p friendly. no big deal. i get a 5 every update unless i dont want any. entertaining until ar 55. it starts getting lonely then... spiral abyss is a blatant dps check making it more strategy focused like last time would be better. pvp is nonexistent but would be a good feature primos are limited to coms and events. add more ways to get them. i cant be paying for welkin every month... overall entertaining but needs more work buff keqing. now.\n",
      "ever since sumeru update my game is always crashing its so frustrating i cant explore and the event has a time limit and this problems of yours are making me disinterest. anymore than this and im quitting been a player since 1.3 and im reaching my limit im been on my burn out stage since sumeru was released.\n",
      "this is the best rpg i have ever played it has great animation and music with a decent storyline. it is also ideal in terms of difficulty level for any kind of gamer with a provision to decrease increase difficulty level after a certain stage. a deserving 5 star game \n",
      "it is a great game i also play on ps4. its a huge size 15gb and can cause phone to overheat and get laggie. also on a personal note i really need want to be able to use a external controller\n",
      "genshin has nice graphics and good story at the start. the game became money hunger when the inazuma was released. they are also that bias to shogun who has the most insignificant story line ever especially the part two where they made her so innocent for whitewashing. characters are also poorly made by recycling other characters skill. game is getting a bit boring especially how repetitive the content is. the anniversary also sucks. the company itself is the problem to much money hunger.\n",
      "great free game if youre patient and save up primogems you can unlock characters without spending money. theres always something to do and you can fight bosses with a friend good stuff.\n",
      "amazing game but you guys need to be more transparent with the community. address the concerns dont ignore them. adding a star because of how much dedication to the lore and world building. would be 5 out of 5 if the gameplay were more polished challenging\n",
      "just started but seems really good so far. graphics are amazing. the story has verbal dialogue throughout and the gear progression leveling system and gameplay seems feature rich. 5 so far\n",
      "i am playing it for 1 year and 6 months now and the experience i had is wonderful after changing my device the crash stopped and i have enjoyed it till date and will be expecting a lot.\n",
      "theres a lot to do in this game but the biggest turn off even for veteran players is the resin system and its endgame. most if not all character upgrades weapon talent etc are behind a resin wall. i know this is to increase the playtime that forces players to come back everyday for making their characters stronger but it just feels so repetitive especially when theres no endgame content. the events are one thing but talking main story wise there is not much to do. cant help but quit.\n",
      "games gives me peace. breath taking landscapes and game music is just so good was really hooked in an instant and i wanna finish this game. but hopefully you will add some end game content it becomes less motivating to play as time goes by just the same old routine\n",
      "fun relax kill the time good to play in free time interesting stories good details many activities to do many cool design characters. this game is all in one also...can u fix the cost of genesis crystals tvt some of them are kinda expensive\n",
      "i love genshin impact and i play it almost everyday my mobile device is kinda good to experience good game but still experiencing some fps drops and sometimes crash under pressure other thing is the wshing system and banners r kinda too high pity as everyone hate the weapons banner but its still my favourite game\n",
      "the game has borderline no problems it updates every 6 weeks and has indepth character lore and world lore its story is captivating.only problem is that i cant continue the aranyaka quest since i got disconnected while talking to rana and now im blocked.\n",
      "excellent game you get to choose to play for free or to make in game purchases its up to you and what you want to get out of it. the fandom has changed a lot and can be toxic but thats the case with any popular game or other entertainment. appreciate the game for what it is and youll love it the animation is beautiful and i consider it to be a pretty mellow game wonderful after a stressful day at work \n",
      "i love everything about this game but the issues i am having are making it unplayable. for starters everytime i get on the game it lags and after about a minute it completely stops and tells me that the game isnt responding every time i get on i have changed my settings to the lowest i could and it still doesnt seem to fix anything. if you could fix this bug then that would be great.\n",
      "aint no way you guys made us do insanely time consuming quests and puzzles for 2 primo gems and a one star artifact. im ar 50 it does nothing for me. you guys need to fix your reward system i dont understand how it gets worse the more you progress through the game. greedy little goblins\n",
      "i used to play on laptop but i lacked storage there now. the reason why its 2stars now is because i play on oppoa94 edit they fixed the yunjin bug but i still have more complains in the graphics of the game 1. the water when im not standing in the water or any water source it suddenly glows and takes up all the screen. 2. damage numbers i cant see my damage or any other damage numbers at all and its getting annoying because idk if i should use this specific character to a domain.\n",
      "i download it in my new phone. its a lot smoother but the screen is glitching so much i have black screen sometimes lights are sometimes a bright red circle... i got a lot of problems and i dont know if this is a bug my its my phone who have the problem...\n",
      "its difficult to switch between gadgets because there is only one slot. how about adding more please include more in game events rather than through websites as it is unpleasant when players are unaware of events that are taking on outside of the game.\n",
      "its a great game with its own flaws but generally good but i really wished it was also on the huawei app gallery. my friends and cousins have wanted to play genshin with me but they cant because its only on the google play store and apple app store not the huawei app gallery wich most of my friends cousins only have becuase theyre on huawei devices.\n",
      "poor customer service. im playing this game since release and spent a decently huge amount of money. i got hacked after 2 years of playing and grinding and the designated team who will handle it seems to have forgotten their job. promised you within 20 business days and guess what its more than a month now. theyre happy when youre spending in their game but when its time to actually help their players they will simply make you wait for nothing.\n",
      "theres not a single sight of problem about the mechanism. but the newest event are boring why dont you just give us something about the main characters life thatd be more interesting for us than other characters they having a bad life so what the main characters life are rigged too. so why bringing up the others life when the main characters life already rigged and we wanted to know more about the main characters and the siblings backgrounds not sum random flute players clan story\n",
      "its a pretty great game i deleted it from my phone a couple of times because of storage maybe a bit of frustration and boredom but i always came back. soon im getting a pc which will definitely help me\n",
      "android is the only platform without controller support. im playing on a tab s8 ultra. touch controls are not practical with a screen that big.\n",
      "i have been playing genshin since 15th july 2021 and its fun. its hard to get bored when playing genshin i get bored because im lazy to do quests . but yes i do recommend genshin impact even if it takes up a lot of storage it deserves it d\n",
      "awesome game but i would like to say that please update the grass damage text ice on water and make them visible because for some peoples phones they cant see those stuff including me i am going to wait patiently for this update. and thank you for updating yun jins glitch so now we can see her or use her without the glitch and same with dvalin.\n",
      "i love the game i just love it there is so much to explore it does take up a lot of storage but it has amazing graphics and they all have unique designs and the voice acting is so funny and good i would recommend this game 10 10\n",
      "yess it is amazing game. where we can cultivate our knowledge and critical thinking through the puzzles. i enjoyed a lot of playing this game especially when a character comes home. however i have a concern in resin its too slow to replenish i would suggest that they would improve it.\n",
      "this game has very nice graphics and quality but personally i think there are many things that need improvement in this game such as event and floor 12 in the spiral abyss difficulty. i also think that the developers should bring a potion food that can refill characters energy. and last thing i think they should increase the resin cap. sometimes players are busy so that they cant use their resin before capped. although you can quickly craft 5 condensed resin its still not enough. thanks.\n",
      "this game is very fun although you have no money to buy food you can always cook them with lots of materials you can earn primogems like ur supposed too and you cant cheat.amazimg game i really recommend it might start being haird but never give up and level up characters and weapons those are the tips for me lol really reccomend it have a good day and stay safe \n",
      "i like this game and the graphics its so awesome and the cool part was when you officially play it there was a story. all the characters so fine and the bar part was just its too big when it comes to storage\n",
      "played for more than a year or so but the problem is that the commissions are repetitive. the game events are not really desirable over time and youll eventually get bored. im rating it as 3 stars since the game needs significant improvements in terms of these things i have mentioned. also forcing players to play for the commissions and their welkin moon is kind of annoying to me. there should be a convenient feature for the welkin moon that charges you more but you dont have to log in.\n",
      "it was a very long wait until everything was registers into the game on my device but it was worth it at the end because now im addicted for the characters the animations the desings of every little thing it is like a gamechanger for me and other than that my friend who recommended me the game got a little jealous after seeing the characters i got at the start when it took him months to get those characters and some he doesnt have. either way i love the game it is amazing\n",
      "gonna update my review after near one year in this game amazing music amazing graphic plus interesting characters and story but the storage requirement is too high i suggest install if you have up to 128gb storage ..... im leaving soon due to storage problem t t\n",
      "probably the best gacha game ive ever played. the story graphics gameplay characters and their designs are amazing. i just hope they fix the lag issues on phone and lower the pity system lol\n",
      "need following 1. remove resin from boss fight as its weekly once... need resin for new artifacts and materials or increase resin generation time and cap. 2. weapon billets from boss fights very rare and random how about give option players to choose what they want from the drop 3. game have many regions to explore increase daily commission to 12 and expeditions to 15.\n",
      "i like the game so much but the screen loads to much even if theres an update everytime i get in it gets laggy idk if its my phone but the wifi is ok. if i play the game it gets laggy even in the storys and when im doing a quest.\n",
      "amazing gameplay graphics audio and sound effect. and the main story for each patch just at another level. now the issue is the size of the game are too big when you actually only playing some of the main event or the daily mission.\n",
      "one of the best open world mobile game i have played so far yes it does have some ups and down like building characters gets hard after lvl 80 and artifacts are hard to come by and i feel like the story line can be improved a little but over all its very immersive i would suggest it to anyone.\n",
      "amazing story and characters cant wait to see all the secrets of the world. first game that made me appreciate time trials without getting too frustrated. 100 10 will recommend.\n",
      "so for beginners this game is pretty good maybe one of the best there is but once you become a veteran it kinda becomes boring. the new content comes every 1 and a half month but only lasts for 10 days maybe. there is serious shortage of content in this game. the quality is okay but quantity is disappointing. you will also feel burn out playing this game for a year or so. i have been playing since launch so i know. so if you are a hardcore gamer who needs a lot of content to enjoy dont.\n",
      "in my opinion this is a great game. all the way down to the graphics and the voice acting its absolutely beautiful. the character designs are lovely too..only my current issue is that monsters will pin me against a wall where im unable to move or escape and fighting against them doesnt help either. other then that this game is beautiful and i find myself getting getting comfortable to play it for hours on end.\n",
      "gorgeous and i mean it. the characters the story the updates adding new content all of the time.... i absolutely adore this game \n",
      "i love the game the new update reminds me of my dream character klee i was willing to have klee for a long time i downloaded a wish simulator to have klee i was happy that i had klee. but now i want klee in the actual game not begging but that lucky players who has alot of 5 stars are good but i didnt get a single 5 star.q\n",
      "if you are newcomer theres a lot of content we can do.. huge exploration with stunning scenery looks simple yet complicated gameplay for nerds world puzzles great depth story and lore well developed characters design and personality with amazing talented voice actors and guaranteed pity in gacha system but still expensive .. if you done all the content new events and new contents updated and lasts in every 6 weeks..\n",
      "the gacha rate is terrible. edit to be fair music and animations of this game are great. however the gacha game companies really need to be transparent about the rate if they want some credibility. we really need a law to force the companies to open source their gacha systems. edit2 but the game trailers are insanely good. it deserves 2 more stars...\n",
      "im glad that more strongboxes were added to the crafting bench. i actually feel like the rng decreased when players are now able to get their desired pieces. the rng on the stats might still be close to similar but in my opinion it is already good enough now that we dont have to worry about getting to spend more time and resin getting incorrect pieces for most characers.\n",
      "overall i really love this game although theres a problem with barbaras idles. it used to be really in sync but now its..not. please try fixing this in future updates other than that this game is amazing 10 10\n",
      "this game is pretty good but i would say that the main problem would be that for some players the constant new features and events may be overwhelming. the game can start to feel like you are doing chores than actually playing a fun game all though the game itself is really good and the story line and characters are very well done \n",
      "i rlly like the game the design characters voice acting and everything else is amazing but the storage is a big big no. as a mobile player the only game i have is this game and my storage is already full also i know the devs already fixed the texture bug glitch on dvalin la signora and yunjin. but i think yall should fix those who have potato phones or 64gb and below phones too. bc me who only have 32gb cannot see the grass ice in the water and sometimes very bad graphics. pls fix thx\n",
      "its good game as far as mobile games go .i have 1 complaint .not enough blood ect it aint a big deal but i personally like it when games are a little more appealing to the adult audience by adding just a bit of extra realism like wounds and blood . eh doesnt matter anyways good game .\n",
      "i edity review cause i love this game the graphic the scenery the characters the events and story every quest and adventures are really good.\n",
      "is there any way to get the wings pf companionship i did not collect it when i played it last year because my phone did not carry the amount of storage this game had and now that i have a better phone i didnt know it has an expiration date. can you please send me it ive been participating in a lot of events in the game. thank you sm \n",
      "this is an amazing game that has lots to do. although it is a it young and still has a long way to go it is still incredible to play and it is very interesting. i would love to watch genshin impact grow into a complete game with many followers\n",
      "this is a good game but it takes too much space. it always crashes when i play it on pc. the graphics are also low in mobile. i love this game somehow.\n",
      "bumping this review because genshins been pretty good as of late events are fine characters are cool sumeru is coming soon. also after playing tower of fantasy it really goes to show just how much attention the devs put into everything in genshin. it is superior in every single way compared to that mess\n",
      "i love this game its absolutely amazing the free roaming you can climb just about anything and glide from those positions also fighting is perfect i love how i can just fight and go at it no turn bais stuff the game is huge but i dont mind the size because its so fun to play i play this more than other games when i have nothing to do at the moment this is a amazing way to have fun while waiting or just playing all day theweponstylesandallthedifferentcaricaturestochoosefromaremyfavorit parts too\n",
      "dear developers i love this game everything is amazing but i cant play because of black screen glitch and too shining light and texture glitch also the objects are shining too much the black screen covering my vision while im playing. my phone is samsung a03 with unisoc chipset and i dont hate this game i love it but i want to play normally without this glitches\n",
      "very fun but has a ton of room for improvement especially at end game which devolves into a monotonous daily grind while waiting for more story to release. its wise to just take breaks between patches but if youre free to play you will feel like you need to play daily to get some of the premium currency used to pull new characters and weapons. if you are willing to spend or dont get too attached as a free to play player though youll just show up when theres content and have good fun.\n",
      "genshin impact is a really enjoyable with many great aspects. my favourite aspects are the world is fun to explore and is entirety free the lore of each region is intriguing with interesting nuances and questions almost all playable characters have their own view on life and the world and it is fun to learn more about them. however there are things that can be improved in general the english translation up to chapter 2 part 2 only serves to convey information and lacks character.\n",
      "amazing game although i do wish for more story quests and i do wish we got the option for choosing a main stat for an artifact every 4 clears would be very fair i would say overall great job.\n",
      "edited rating i really enjoy this game and all but it takes up a lot of space on your phone. i had to delete the app because im unable to play because of low storage while my phone space is completely fine and doesnt cause a problem at all its bc the game uses up way to much space on my phone to comfortably play. but im lucky im able to play on ps4. aside from that im really looking forward to scaramouches banner. good luck to you all on your pulls \n",
      "last update is probably the worst update ever. the best thing about this game is you can clearly see how much effort devs put in this game but not this time. the story of the event was such a disappointment. the puzzles are broken it cant be solved. im starting to question if they even tested the game before updating it. i think this update was made by interns while the lead devs are working on sumeru project.\n",
      "disappointing how terrible and shady the team behind this game is. not to mention their business practices. well deserved the one star rating. sure enough the game is beautiful and all but the fun dies out after you reach endgame where theres nothing to do.\n",
      "its a very good game and has good graphics but i noticed some bugs been trying to beat a level and i also lag very much the screen freezes i thought my game crashed after it freezes it starts again it bothered me for some time now\n",
      "i love this game its my favourite game. the only issue is recently the game has been glitching going all dark and black screened. i cant see a thing and its really irritating especially during battles. even the party setup has weird red lights all over the screen making it look like some diamond city lights please do fix this issue\n",
      "breathtaking landscapes to explore and the lores are top notch. however the resin limit can be quite a turnoff when youre a high ar player. rewards for killing mini bosses or minions if underwhelmingly petty. the genesis crystal value is ridiculous that its not even worth purchasing.\n",
      "i love this game im only giving it one star to get the devs attemtion some of their characters models are glitch where everything except for their face is invisible. if anyone can help it will be appreciated.\n",
      "i love this game so much its just kinda angering me thatvi cant complete a quest. i died while doing the quest the lost child and now i cant go back into that zone cuz there are these plant barriers. so its impossible for me to complete that task now \n",
      "the art style is really beautiful and the background music is so catchy i always stop whatever i do to listen. thats the only positive feedback i could give\n",
      "the customer support is terrible i lost my ar 59 account and provided enough evidence and data yet they cant even retrieve my account and it even takes them 1 2 weeks to reply and all response are automated. i played this game for more than 630 days and spent thousands of my own money but now that my account is hacked they wont do anything to retrieve it.\n",
      "there is a bug where is after the hoyovers logo the screen just goes white and it never shows the genshin logo and it never updateds like its frozen and i have checked its not my device nor my internet connection i play on samsung galaxy note 9 and my internet speed is very good please i need a quick answer about this issue.\n",
      "the thing that infuriates me is the characters design. this game is based on all the different cultures of the world. all the other nations are nearly perfect except sumeru the nation in question is supposed to be inspired by the middle east. for example their ruler is a tiny pale child which does not represent one part of the middle east while the other rulers represent everything perfectly. dont even get me started on the skin colors and all the other orientalist stereotypical designs.\n",
      "amazing game very high quality and the character designs always blow me away with the attention to detail backstory and more the stories are always great and the 2.7 one was very moving and i loved the animations for the backstory of the yakashas. though the game could have a few improvements for example increasing resin cap and better artifact rng overall one of the best games ive ever played\n",
      "the game fun. generally the pity gacha system aint as bad as i initially thought it was. just requires some serious grinding to get enough pulling material. the artifact farming system is pure rng. its annoying to deal with forsure but other than that its a great game.\n",
      "been playing for years but.. it is the best mobile game ever. the events and updates are always coming so you never run out of things to do. i really respect their hard work and effort into keeping us going with content. but im annoyed as someone who buys only on this game that its one of the few that doesnt accept play points that we rack up from purchasing in their game to use when making even more buys. just seems stingy they had option for all of about a day or two then gone\n",
      "i downloaded this game as soon as i got a new phone i hope i downloaed this game much earlier but my old phone cant handle it my old phone storage is only 852mb i though it wasnt fun but i was wrong i was really amazed im kinda obsessed with this game but im getting bored when i reached ar 54 i stayed for summeru and zhongli c2 and for dainslef i lost 50 50 and get qiqi i hope its diluc instead but i still love this game highly recommend sorry for my bad grammar \n",
      "you will have a great moment in this game as there is many good things to say about it. awesome music awesome gameplay quite good story many place to explore and f2p friendly. events are happening every few days so there will be content to do. never stop playing since day 1.\n",
      "fun game but i would love to see an easier multiplayer option. plus levelling up your characters weapons talents artifacts etc becomes requires epic levels of grinding resin and materials at higher levels. some world quests are way too easy to get stuck on leaving you having to give up on main quests or even the overall game quest no matter what your level and your characters are at. ive had to ask friends to pass these levels for me so i can continue.\n",
      "love the 2.8 update but im having a small problem with kazuhas burst. it doesnt zoom in every once in a while when i use his burst though he is a 5 star. i hope you can fix this soon \n",
      "awesome game. personally im very picky when it comes to games because most games bore me out really quickly and most if not all of them last for like no more than 3 days in my apps list. this game however made me play it for more than a year already. genshin is awesome. tho they should improve on endgame content .\n",
      "i can not play at all. i was very excited to download it and play but when i do it says insufficient storage space errorcode 9907. it needed 14gb and i deleted about 16 and it was not working. please fix this. them i will happily remove this rating and i will play.\n",
      "this game is absolutely fantastic. i would completely reccomend it for anime and landscape lovers. the characters have a perfect personality fitting their looks. im very impressed this is a great game 100000000000000000 5\n",
      "ive been playing since launch. the game was then a beautiful fun experience. so what happened now its a total phone killer. lags. glitches. doesnt work. the issues are widespread discussed heavily on the official forums but customer service is refusing to address the fact that the new update makes the game barely playable for android users. \n",
      "every time i try to log into this game it says the login is a success but the game never moves past the first screen. the only button on the screen to push takes me right back to the login page where im free to login again and it will tell me it is a success and again the game will still not play.\n",
      "good games like the open world..just wish we can pick a mage as ur first character but other than that its all good doesnt glitch the controls are easy to use.....thanks for the game\n",
      "can you make it more mobile friendly first i can play it only with very low graphics. second even then it drains a lot of battery and cant play for long time. other than that this game is really good. nice music and great quests with lot of enemies. its really fun \n",
      "super bad experience why i am being showed story that i dont want to watch. i have to keep tapping to skip for minutes. super bad customer experience.\n",
      "why people hate gi bc its anime style its one of the best games ive seen in a long time. the story is very good yeah the traveler is very op but then we wouldnt have a story . game play is very addictive and the graphics are like from a dream. for beginners its pretty hard to understand and they need to get ar 10 which is pretty annoying bc you dont know what you can do to get to it. the gacha system is very bad for f2p but i mean you need to get money someway.\n",
      "the best but still open for a lot of improvement. updates can be the following constellation on or off. resetting of challenges.. and give users a ton of free characters especially 5 stars.\n",
      "really love this game . but the biggest problem is the size but which have the completed requirements dont regret downloading it and one last thing real love the characters and the gliding system\n",
      "absolutely fantastic game with great storys beautiful characters that you want to love and interesting gameplay thats easy to understand and has a lot of room to optimize. but my god does this use so much storage\n",
      "hi i like this game a lot and i think its really pog and very addictive i can play it for hours and hours but the update is taking a very long time its been over 3 days already but other than that there is nothing more i have to say. pog \n",
      "even they as a mobile player there are a few problems its still an amazing game. i like to play this when im home since nowhere else has fast amazing wifi however when im st work or outside busy im always looking forward to go home to play the game \n",
      "wow cant believe this is a mobile game. been a hardcore pc gamer my whole life but never expected such a game for mobile devices. surprisingly this game isnt much of a battery drainer even on medium settings. device 6gb ram sd 870 \n",
      "game has amazing story and character design. has a beautiful open world. i wish it was a bit more lenient towards its gacha system. instead of gaining a pity at 99 they could have done something like punishing gray raven where pity is at 60. other then that good game\n",
      "its great game though i wish there was controller support for android such an xbox controller or playstation. making a common controller would be best to use. since its be more accessible.\n",
      "i love the game and i was playing on my phone but i wanted to play on my brand new laptop so i downloaded it and it took me 26 hours to download to 80 since i have slow internet but then suddenly it went back to 0 all my download progress disappeared. it makes me want to cry\n",
      "i believe that this game is very entertaining and is good for a time killer. the storage use is a problem though. it is an enormous and fun game. i would advise getting it if you want to give up a ton of storage.\n",
      "i love this game its very additive and lots of fun. i like how big the world is in it. and the storylines are very cool graphics are awesome as well. would recommend downloading it \n",
      "great game i cant stop playing the graphics are amazing and whats ever more impressive is the open world and its various regions and enemies. this game is truly fun and i enjoy every moment of it. but if i have to make a complaint itll be that its a little difficult to play on mobile when i cant adjust my controls\n",
      "this game is awsome the graphics are amazing the story the characters the events but i have two suggestions for the devs 1 the primogems are one of the most important things in the game how could you do wishes without them i know you can use the stardust so if you make getting primogems easier or lower the price of the wishes it will be great. 2 the game has a super entertaining co op mode so after all why not just add a pvp mode imagine deluc fighting khaya in monstead and thx a lot\n",
      "im done with the game. been stuck on the white screen after the hoyoverse logo. have done everything i can think of to fix this but i dont think theres one. so thanks genshin for the fun stories.\n",
      "the recent update has a lot of special events. but the puzzle is so confusing and has no clues. it feels like a chores to me.\n",
      "i like how the story was its so fascinating on every quest i love the game and every playstyle of characters me and my friends playing this since first release of genshin hope they add more featured character.\n",
      "best music ever traveller main story and archon quest has very high potential..the main trailer is just too good exploration areas are great but content is lacking after 2 3 weeks into the new version.... theres just not much to do except commission and resin..so only thing making me do it are the next version update but this should be fixed as not everyone is willing to wait while doing nothing..\n",
      "the game wont even open after the 2.5 update and the experience was getting increasingly worse over the past year in every respect... worse graohics and even worse performance than ever before. glitchy story quest cutscenes weird graining etc. the customer support also doesnt really prove useful. edit june 2022 there are performance improvements as far as i can see and for the first time in 2 yrs cutscenes are not glitchy.\n",
      "production wise 2.8 is excellent. the new events and gameplay is innovative but most will unfortunately remain a time exclusive limited content.\n",
      "i love genshin but now everytime i try to log in it wont let me. i keep resetting my password and it knows i have an account yet everytime i try to log back in it gives me a account or password error so 2 stars. edit 5 stars now because i got my account back \n",
      "great game but what is with the graphic i mean i just got a new brand phone with 6 core and 8 ram that should even works better then a laptop then why i cant get a medium graphic and be stuck on low with yellow overheating rate please adjust the graphics thank u for the lovely game\n",
      "id love to actually rate the games contents but im not gonna let my phone sit all night just to download these resources shouldve taken wayyyy less time to download all that bc im so tired of sitting here waiting that im just gonna go find something else that takes way less than 8 hours to fully download. and my connection is literally as good as it gets expitidite that and then maybe i can actually try this out for real.\n",
      "edit see you in 7 years. when all region is unlocked hopefully i play this game since early days of release. at first i really enjoy this game. exploring the map treasure hunt unveils the story. but now im at ar 59 the games feels emptier. the endgame state is 10 gameplay 90 waiting. man i kinda hope this game is a one time buy game with dlc so i can enjoy the game anytime i want.\n",
      "hi genshin i really love this game but there is one issue whenever i had to update for the new 2.8 version it kept on saying go to the hoyolab i went there and now what pls help best regards genshin player that probably hadnt touched grass in a really long time. thanks \n",
      "i love the game but i dont think that wishing should be so expensive and multiple of the characters take months of grinding prior to get and not everyone has time nor energy to spend getting on just to do the same stuff over and over gor day or months just to lose a 50 50 for a character. other than that and the ping issues ive been getting its awesome\n",
      "bad bad bad this game looks great and thats why it is so demanding my phone will get really warm thats why i just wanna keep my hands away and play with a controller but no they dont support it yet for no obvious reason because it is supported on ios.\n",
      "i play genshin on my computer sometimes but i cant use my computer when im not home. genshin is a great game..but when it comes to the massive amount of storage it takes on my phone i cant even download it because of the fact that it takes up so much storage. ive deleted almost everything on my phone and i still cant download it. i know most of us would like to actually be able to play but we cant because how much storage this game takes up.\n",
      "a really good game. the developers have put so much work into this game the graphics the characters its just too much for free game. open world games are my fav. the only thing i dont like is the chance of getting a really good artifacts which is really rare. but this is just a small thing compared to the whole game. i also love the music and the osts. truly a masterpiece\n",
      "the 1st rpg game i play and really love ittt though ive been having issues lately.. i did file verification yet it says theres nothing to repair but in game it freeze itll definitely be a 5 star if i didnt have this issue ..\n",
      "i gave it a 4 star rating cause i have a few problems first is the bug about the bosses davalin and signora they are glitching like crazy and another bug is when i want to ice bridge i cant see the ice and the bug about yun jin and when i use bursts my enemies health would disappear but they arent even dead and id really appreciate it if you fix it and thank you\n",
      "genshin impact do be my first ever game that i loved the most until now tho getting a character of your wish might be hard but the story the character and everything is just too fun and i am happy to get to play this game which is available at all platforms with good graphics thank you developers for creating this game and wish to see the game get further achievements\n",
      "alot of fun beautiful animation characters and just everything also very user friendly and easy to learn.\n",
      "1 single player no guilds no end game combat content. 1a no dungeons 1b no bosses raids 1c no pvp 2 spiral abyss 2a too reliant on gimmicks and too easy. reduce the number of cheese mobs shields etc a few of them are fine but some versions have every floor down to shields which makes drafting very resttuctive . 2b remove the time limit and floor limit. speedruns for leaderboards are lame. the strongest account playerskill combination should be the top and not the player spaming reset \n",
      "update im able to play the game and i absolutely love it. my only real problem is my millinial mountain quest is glitched and im pretty sure its preventing me from unlocking places which i really need to do\n",
      "the game takes too much time and storage. getting the things i want takes even longer and the system is too repetitive.\n",
      "so new update made it worse. its lagging and when you click on the map u just stay on the map forever and cant get out. its soo annoying. ik that u have to wait but am a impatient person so i get irritated fast. so that slow thing is making me lose my mind tbh.\n",
      "hmm....there are pros and cons to this game. if you have a friend to play and share with it would be enjoyable playing it alone will be boring once you finish all the events. lastly weapon banner is a trap lol ... dont give in to temptation \n",
      "this games are pretty but i really bummed out that i cant ever get any chance of playing the past events if the event not had serious lore related to main stories just side story i might not be this salty seeing it in youtube had different experience to it the older player also very elitist to newbie and artifact system are bad anyway i cant justify pay playing the games with no complete story who always rigged you so bad to the point of madness this game really not a new player friendly\n",
      "dear genshin impact im rating your game agian and it still lags every update and it lags me out after a certain amount of time goes by i get lagged out and the ar lv. 25 rank up is impossible to beat damn near. i love genshin impact so much but u got to to fix the lag. please fix the lag and the ar lv rank up.\n",
      "i honestly just installed this game because of your add. you see i need a new intern as internbob is eloping and was wondering if i could have yours to replace her. tell them that advertising in the 34th century is even more fun and more dangerous it will be fine ...ish probably. trust me lm a spaceship salesman. lakon marketing division keelback office only ship in the galaxy to come equipped with a soul \n",
      "this game is open world and can be quite fun however most over time it starts to lose its appeal. some of the quests that you do later in game are teidous and difficult and sometimes it blocks co op until you finish the quest and it wont let you exit the quest. as for the characters theyre fun to grind for but the way the app gives you nothing to even get the characters is brutal. the game is mostly p2w and the company and community are toxic. the app also takes up a lot of space.\n",
      "very very fun and interactive game but some of the quests will freeze for some reason. idk is it bcos im playing on mobile or what but its very very very very annoying pls fix it asap\n",
      "great game. although it is infuriating at times due to it partially being a luck based game the gameplay graphics story is really good. 4 stars because i havent gotten zhongli and kazuha yet ehe. will change it once i do. edit i have gotten zhongli now kazuha left ehe edit i now have both \n",
      "comfort game. everything is amazing about it. characters to graphics. the fandom is problematic but the game is amazing. i cant believe its free. thank you for your hardwork \n",
      "alothought the game has good plot and good graphics and all it has poor representation and the chacters are pale white most i was disappointed in most of the sumaru characters and i hope this will somehwat change on the upcoming nations and also the issue with the big size of the game other games have bigger maps and events and have a smaller size please find away to fix this somehow otherwise most players wont make to khanreia end of the game \n",
      "the graphics are out of thid world. holy frick yes it does take up quite alot of space but in my opinion this game is worth every gigabite it takes up . the graphics are so high quality its. breathtaking even for a video game \n",
      "this game feels abandoned complacent... i feel it has a few moments where it is 5 then a lot of 4 moments but a lot boils down to a constant lack of content on top of the same stuff that youve seen over and over again. the core mechanics and world i enjoy but the lack of fine tuning and expansion of in game content and things to do starts to run me dry\n",
      "its good scenery music character stories its such a good game but your pity system sucks im always on hard pity 77 84. the pity system of the game makes me want to quit.\n",
      "first rpg game ive ever played i liked to try this game because the anime inspired character at first then the more i played it the more i liked it especially with the music production in the game really inspiring for hobbyists musician like me ... and you can play this game for free \n",
      "what an awesome game but i just wished that the rewards of the game would increase spending time on the game and getting only few and less rewards is not worth it. but overall the game is a masterpiece.\n",
      "i gotta say before the latest update this game has been an absolute blast but now there are glitches everywhere when i was playing a domain the visual keep going wonky and dark which is a huge annoyance when youre fighting fatuis left and right while not being able to see them and then theres also the matter of some of the world quest not starting as it should when you arrived at the destination ive tried everything from closing and reopening to restarting my device \n",
      "the game has a good sound track and good graphics. the travelers story is perfect and the characters is also awesome. how ever the game is too expensive especially in brazil. i cant have good characters or a good development on the game without paying for it which i cant because i cant give 52 of the brazilian money to have a random character or anything else.\n",
      "my wifi speed is currently on 200mbps but im experiencing lags and delays. my phone even has 120 refresh rate. i dont understand how lagging works in this infuriating game. in game purchases wont even guarantee you your most wanted character or weapon even with a times two first purchase bonus.\n",
      "my game is still downloading but i will give it 5 stars because i see meny youtubers play genshin and the graphics is totally satisfying the effects and everything is just great from what i heard and seen from youtube also by ads im am very excited to play this game edit sadly i cant play this game i dont have enough storage bc the game took it all... very sad to be honest i was looking forward for this game.. but yet still a amazing game so 4 stars..\n",
      "the game is pretty good however most stuff is locked beyond a rng random number generator wall. getting characters you want is easy because of their sistem however building said character requires artifacts and these artifacts are 100 rng. if there would be less rng it would be better\n",
      "cant use ive been trying to download this game for sooooo long but it wont work first it says im in europe even tho im in america when i use email then i make and account and it keeps kicking me out once i press start and wont download anything i dont know if its because im on android or something but it made me very sad. please fix \n",
      "awesome game runs well on my phone despite heating and battery but ill give you a pass on that the only major issue i have with it on the phone is the controls the touch controls for someone like me where aiming well is required suck sadly you cant use keyboard mouse like on pc with dex samsungs desktop environment and doesnt let you use controllers please fix this \n",
      "i love the graphics and the charters are pretty good and the quest are so cool but i get pretty lazy sometimes and you can play with friends only when youre rank 16 me and my bff are trying to get to rank 16 i recommend this app for you its really great \n",
      "with a beautiful open world interesting storylines and a unique assortment of characters genshin impact keeps me coming back constantly. while you can decide to spend some money you can enjoy almost everything the game has to offer for free aside from some premium outfits. whether you like combat strategy puzzles or even dating sims genshin impact has something for just about everyone. definitely my favorite mobile game especially since it breaks the normal mobile game expectations \n",
      "pretty good game except for the fact it glitches and slows down tremendously after around 11pm cst. im assuming its due to it being close to reset time 3am cst but i feel its still too early before 2am cst.\n",
      "i spent 200 dollars and lost 50 50 in a row how could you take so much money and not give anything getting a unwanted constellation is like getting nothing so much money wasted dont spend lots of money on this game or you will regret it. im surprised these kinds of games dont get taken down like wth you take so much money and make a system that doesnt know it and gives what ever\n",
      "this is my absolute favorite game ive ever had i never regret getting it graphics are breathtaking the voices are great and everything works even just on my phone 10 10 game highly recommended \n",
      "worst game not starting showing the issue of internet at time of wifi. also there is no travelling object except sea there should be a traveling object in which you can sit controll it to climb and travelling companion like a puma or a canine or a bird type animal.\n",
      "awesome game love all about it both lucky and unlicky moments when pulling lol. exploration lore gameplay character design and moveset everything is just amazing.\n",
      "ive had the game for a while and i still cant connect a controller to it. ive seen other people do it. the tab for it is literally missing in the settings. my phone isnt the best but its one of the newer ones galaxy s21\n",
      "it is worth giving it a try for newer players updates every month and feels like a 60 dollar game with a lot of content. for older returning players the 1st anniversary was lackluster hopefully 2nd is better. artifact progression has been slightly improved but still an rngfest. no real endgame content for about two years so youll eventually be only running these artifact domains between updates.\n",
      "the game could have been great if the devs would actually listen to the community. the music and graphics are so good but the developers are figuratively deaf when it comes to taking actual suggestions that is beneficial for everyone.\n",
      "overall a positive experience. i love the versatility of each characters abilities and huge open world environment. however i do wish there was a way to store more resin or have an afk mechanism that utilizes excess resin while not playing. hopefully when this game reaches it final area they expand it by allowing the characters to cross realms via the ley lines.\n",
      "2 months of content and finished the game.... now you just login do comissions spend the tiniest amount of resin 160 which generates very slowly.... and then wait for sumeru which takes like ages no wonder this game is slowly dying whats worse is the pitty system if you dont spend enough money you dont get the character you want \n",
      "i give it a 4 so far just because but seriouslyyyyy the space required for the game. literally took up the rest of my phones storage which was 20gb left so the graphics and gaming experience is laggish on me sadly . . \n",
      "it fun there is real money however you can ignore it and play for free completely fine however with a galaxy 9s the phone am using to play it runs great however it doesnt let you connect a game control what disappointing because it still not on switch\n",
      "amazing graphics fun play so far only have 4 characters thinking they are core and level 8 adventurer. this will be a fun game for ages \n",
      "its good meeting a lot of friends and enjoy playing with them. but i hope they fix the other devices problems where they dont see grass ice and their damage text.\n",
      "i have the game on my phone so i can play when i travel but i prefer a controller and it wont let me connect a controller to the game. would like controller input.\n",
      "this game is amazing. put your mind at ease in matter of seconds but its resin regeneration is too slow which makes the lower odds of getting good artifacts even lower.\n",
      "ar 55 not enough endgame content. also the newest sumeru designs are orientalist. game gets boring once you reach a high ar plus quests have way too much dialogue. fun game when you start but gets boring once you reach endgame. also add a trading system please i dont want my raiden shogun anymore\n",
      "as long as you have a good performance phone and storage it is really good. excited for sumeru coming out in about a month from.\n",
      "im totally addicted with this game ...the design and experience is spectacular...for me its a wonderful game with nice storyline...the one who spoil it is only my own account... its very unlucky like bennett as i never win 50 50 like my friends get and i always get hard pity or lost at high pity...that just make me a sad girl t t\n",
      "the story is great especially sumeru but everything else is terrible. the gacha system is very predatory. as a player that buys bp and welkin and sometimes crystals i feel robbed. as someone that pays money i feel like is supposed to get at least one limited 5 star per version. the artifact grind is terrible. im building raiden since the start the of the game and she still mid at best. the resin system limits your gameplay to 15 min a day if you are a veteran player.\n",
      "i really love this game but when i started to play the archon quests the immovable god and the external euthymia chapter ii act 1 my screen went black while the music still going on... so i thought it was just normal until 10 15 minutes my screen is still black l.. why \n",
      "this is so horrible that i will have to quote chloe from mlb. ridiculous utterly ridiculous i deleted almost every app on my phone deleted big photos and guess what. the stupid game still said it wouldnt load bc i had no space im literally gonna rip my hair out bc people always make tiktoks or whatever but when i try to play it doesnt work this game is so dumb i couldnt even play. whoever made this game if a phone isnt able to run it without exploding dont make it avaible on phones.\n",
      "game is gorgeous with awesome music and an engaging story. as with most f2p games you can spend money to make it easier but not required. extra time and planning is required to move forward. be sure not to advance your adventure rank too fast and youll have fun.\n",
      "as a new player its good lots to do and explore. later on all you will do is dailies and wait for the next area. for now its a 3 star since it is a great game but for late game players its just not good enough.\n",
      "please.... optimize the gameplay for mobile users. my phone can handle the game just fine and more but optimize it for mobile. when will there be controller support for android you have more android users than ios in total. please work on game performance as well fix the lag bugs and glitches.\n",
      "i freaking love this game. been playing for a year and holy sh am i addicted now. the events are really cool and i love the music in the game. not to mention how much detail they put into characters clothing design and personality. helps if youre trying to learn to draw anime too since you have a full 360 view of a character. only thing im waiting on is a pet the dog feature but other than that i love this \n",
      "my phone has 8gb ram 128gb rom snapdragon 720g and adreno 610. but the game is still lagging and sometimes i get fps drops even on low graphics quality. my phone model is samsung a71. please help me fix this thank you \n",
      "very fun and interesting rpg. the mechanics are amazing the graphics are beautiful and the story makes you want to keep playing. ive been playing since may of 2021 and i can say ive had fun the entire time.\n",
      "while it is known for being very artistic and very musical and an awesome open world my only small gripe is that it takes like 20 gigabytes for me to have it running on the low setting on my tablet. but all i all i came for the open world and stayed for the husbandos\n",
      "its really fun great game play lore but i really wish that it had more diversity in it cos the current dark skined characters have the same skin tone as me a white person you should really read the feedback hoyoverse cos it is a cool game but alot of people are disappointed for good reasons\n",
      "this is good but the only thing is that i cant see grass ice bridges and damage text i hope you can fix this for us bad phone players if so it would mean alot to me and the others \n",
      "game is extremely good. however im giving low rating until we have controller support on android. there is an api for this enabling controller support should be super simple yet we dont have it.\n",
      "great game for a mobile level intanse graphic with great story line. but need some improvement and options to user to reduce graphic more for stable performance for low end devices.\n",
      "after a year has passed i would say the story of this game is beyond masterpiece it likes you reading your favourite novel then that novel just made into a movie but turnout you can control your character in that movie to progress at your own pace. just play this game for stories is beyond watching a thousand movies.\n",
      "its a really good game and all and i really enjoy playing it but when i hook my playstation controller to my phone i can play all my other games just like it was on a playstation except for this one and you think that since its such a detailed game that when i have the controller hooked up to my phone i should be able to play\n",
      "is a fun game you can co op with other people or explore around the map. the story is good and fun to play with character all good and will want to get it.\n",
      "as a person who has 32 gigabytes the storage space is too much for my device and now i cant play the 2.8 update.the games features are ridiculous.the wishing system is basically pay to win.there are no replayable game modes.\n",
      "addicting as hell. gameplay is stunning graphics are beautiful everything is absolutely immaculate. but the game is expensive and theres too much luck required just to have fun. the developers are rather racist when it comes to characters and representation and how they show different cultures. theres a distinct lack of darker characters and south asian cultures as well as blatant disrespect in using native american cultures as a base for enemies.\n",
      "this game is extremely good its like on another level.. the graphics are amazing the characters lore and attacks are really interesting.. although i experienced alot of glitches atleast you give me primos for apologies \n",
      "been ages since they gave iphones controller support but android is still stuck with touch inputs. works pretty well but it causes my phone to overheat. the variation of character skin tone is abysmal and the game really likes to show off the girls asses. if the optimization was made better so my hands arent getting burned everytime i play on mobile and some tweaks to art direction and writing were made id definitely give it a 5.\n",
      "i love the game but it feels really stingy despite how much money they make. another issue is the lack of skin tone variation given to both npcs and playable characters giving borderline every character a whiter skin tone despite the culture they are based on.\n",
      "i really like this game. the graphic characters gameplay and ect except for the gacha system. its super hard to get primogems for the character you want but i dont really mind since this game is free. edit pls fix your artifacts and resin system. i keep geting trash artifacts and even if i get a good one it keep rolling to def \n",
      "hi i personally love genshin impact but the one little bit im complaining about is the skin inclusiveness the fact that there are only 2 ingame playable characters that are tanned and personally hurts. they need to add more characters representing and inclusive in darker skin tones and the new explorable place sumeru has more darker npcs very happy of. but the fact they couldnt add playable characters that are darker toned annoys me do better hoyoverse.\n",
      "you could at least be upfront with the actual amount of space you will need to play. couldnt even actually play because i didnt have space to download the actual game. the game is not infact 206 mb its actually 17 000 thanks for not telling me until after i went through the rest of it\n",
      "there is no account security. i have linked my twitter and google to my game but it still managed to get hacked. and not only that i submitted the account recovery retrieval form in their mail but still no reply in almost 2 weeks. now the hacker changed my account name as well as artifacts in my characters. now i see there are changes in my hoyolab info as well. the hackers manage to destroy the accounts but devs and support cannot reply to a single recovery request in 2 weeks.\n",
      "okay first of all kudos to story writers and open world designers.. its a breath of fresh air visiting sumeru.. it gave the old good feeling i got from first time exploring genshin world with breathtaking environment with music and verticality.. now 2nd thing the whole sumeru archon quest is by far the best written stuff.. only issue i had with it is since this quest was like 5 6 hrs long i wish it had complete auto mode cuz tapping mc dialogues was tiring\n",
      "overall the game play is amazing but for low mobile phones doesnt have grass damage text and ice to see the game is really good but how about low mobile players how they supposed to enjoy the game without some things to see.\n",
      "the music is super good and the characters are so detailed and the lore is very good that i want to know everything im excited for this game to finish and i love exploring the game the map is so big i want to collect all the colus 10 10 everyone should enjoy it alot\n",
      "this game is actually really impressive. personally id suggest playng on pc or playstation but mobile works in a pinch. despite all the youtube videos of people throwing thousands of dollars at the game you can easily play and clear everything but the endgame time trial without spending money or doing huge amounts of grinding.\n",
      "this game is so much fun just what ive been looking for in an open world game. no auto play need cause it keep u in the game searching for everything its all so plentiful but still fun. im glad i found this game. great product\n",
      "i have been playing since release and im reaching endgame. i love this game and have easily dedicated more than 1.5k hours into it but it feels like theres a lack of content for committed players. would really love to see some more co op modes like a multiplayer abyss or larger lobbies with raid style bosses\n",
      "great game for a mobile game but i suggest that i rather play on pc ps if the game keeps crashing and having glitchs on mobile devices. it would be great too if we have a resin free content to do especially for the players who are at adventure rank 50 60 or world level 7 8 thats all i have too say for now and really a great game to play but still can be better.\n",
      "ok ok anyone thinking about downloading or beginning to play genshin . i need you to be prepared to not get everything you want. .. people get very frustrated for not getting things they want and it can be like that in games too its a nice game so i would recommend putting your time into it.\n",
      "the game is great but theres no grass damage and ice. also the water is glowing. i just bought new phone but its still the same i hope hoyo fix it.\n",
      "genshin is easily a 10 10 for me a player who got into the game late if feels like theres so much to do in the world of teyvat the characters and the world itself is beautiful the quest are fun in my opinion and the story is alluring all in all genshin is amazing\n",
      "very nice game its funny that both the characters you can choose to be whichever your choose your have a different game life path both the paths are kinda the same except the fact that a lot a things and where the characters are are very different \n",
      "it was a good game a great one even but its main flaw is its disgusting lack of representation. the characters are literally white not the skin tone white the color white. the melanated characters are literally lighter then most white people and its just gross. i dont understand how you can say your game is about representation when you only represent your country and your customs. you cant just slap on a bad aladdin remake and call it representation\n",
      "very planned out story and all character designs are beautiful my only problem is the storage and the amount of stuff i need to delete\n",
      "i think the bug was just my phone but if it is on the game then thanks it dissapeard.genshin impact was porbably the reason games changed this days genshin impact is a tough competeter for other games since it has a nice ghrapics really good storyline and has a really big community i hope i can see this game grow more.i suggest you guys download it.for the other players there that is complaining about not having story quest..please remember that the game is still under development \n",
      "this is one of the best games but theres a catch .. dont play this if you dont have self control on spending or you dont have a good enough income to support spending around 10 15 per month.\n",
      "its very time killing its good to play when bored the stories are very good i love it so much though it takes alot of gb but thats alright its a very fun game to play. you can even play and make friends there \n",
      "had this game on my laptop and it was amazing absolutely beautiful graphics it has a nice challenge to it too from parts of what i played on my laptop. i say had because the size of it got quite large so i had to uninstall but i enjoyed it nonetheless \n",
      "im a new player in genshin impact. so far i love the fact that i could cross play on my phone samsung galaxy s21 ultra ps4 and even on pc. the only problem is that this game is lagging so bad in mobile. even if my phone is really capable of running high graphic games and the lack of invert x and y with the camera on phone and pc. ive got used to having all of my games inverted so i am having a hard time whenever i play on my mobile and pc which makes me forced to play only on my ps4.\n",
      "heyy some of the scene dont have a voice ..the scene when beidou first appearance some of her voice is missing even when paimon talking dont have a voice ..i already tried to file verification and it say some file are missing ..i already restart the game but its still the same others scene like that too they dont have a voice pleaseee fix jt t.t\n",
      "very nice game the graphics is very good quality the characters and weapons are very well done.although you should try adding sounds to world quest i feel like it will be way better\n",
      "ping issues just continue to get worse the more is added to the game and believe me ive checked my internet many times and it isnt the problem does ping have to do with storage or something all i know is i was having issues before and now that sumeru is out its gotten worse\n",
      "nah i had to since this 28 update my genshin keep lagging one move it goes lag and dissapear after a minute or more.. seriously i love this game but pls i dont think this is my connection problem cuz i played other games its not lagging like this. i found my ping is red all the times in this update. no green at all\n",
      "great games graphics are amazing and control is simple and best i really like the game the game size is such large around 16 gb but very great game i am playing the game on medium setting bcz of lag bcz its such a large and heavy games personally recommend for high devices gamers........and yes its one of the best game ever in top 5 yes.......thank you.\n",
      "anyway the game is alot of fun at first but after that its just grinding u want to keep playing the story im sorry u need at he ar lvl 18 u want to play this epic event u need at be least ar 32 what can new player do grind some useless side quests every day unti they reach the ar requirements i guess and if u got a character u and really like good luck getting it i wish i have mona. this game pushs you to spent money now of course they have to make some money at least give us 5 star\n",
      "i have loved this game since it released with its wonderful music really creative open world and wonderful characters. however as sumeru characters have been shown i cant help but feel that theyre following orientalist stereotypes that have always been harmful to swana people. i hope hoyoverse listens to the people who are criticising this aspect and do something about it.\n",
      "the game has a very interesting well written story exploring is a lot of fun even tho some puzzles can seem very stupid and hard most of them arent the only problem is the lack of content you can always do versions offer new quests and events sometimes areas and new characters but thats it once you finish those the only thing you can keep doing is farming materials which is hard with the resin capacity being low but overall id recommend you play its very fun esp at the beginning\n",
      "i love this game the wide open is beautiful. everything is great except for its rng resins and the storage it consume on my device. i dont think i can last long for many updates to come.\n",
      "in my opinion this game is really fun and amazing. the only thing i personally dont like is the fact that it takes up so much storage mobile players like me have really laggy game content because my phone doesnt have a lot of storage.\n",
      "absolutely love the game the graphics and character designs are every thing however the way you guys got inspiration for hilichurls from indigenous people and continue to perpetuate colonial ideologies and depict us as savages which is directly made from white supremacy isnt okay also not to mention the counless other racist depiction and ca that is in this game also the way the wishes are set up is annoying i havent gotten a new character in like 9 months 1 year yall need to do better\n",
      "not trying to be rude but i dont like this game at all. it keeps making me sign in and it says my password is incorrect but my password is. it also says i dont have enough storage when i deleted 6 games most of my pictures and i cleared the cache on all of my apps. i dont like it at all i couldnt even play it once cause it kept on saying i didnt have enough storage.\n",
      "game runs smoothly on my phone on medium graphics settings but my characters dmg as well as the grass are not showing. i have tried lowering the graphincs but nothing changed.\n",
      "the game is fun but the way you get characters is very hard and the spiral abyss is very hard especially for f2p.but genshin is a very nice game that you can explore get new characters and experience the amazing maps and mobs\n",
      "im a full time worker during the day this game help me trough a lot of severe depresion because every time i come back from work i would be happy exploring teyvat. i love this game because its give us option to causally play this come from someone who play lots of jrpg since 2002 \n",
      "i love this game but i think there should be some features that will really help players a lot. i suggest having an option where you can skip all dialogs in every quests. as a player who has weak wifi every now and then id have to re do cutscenes and read the dialogs over and over again. id appreciate it very much if it was added into the game. much thanks.\n",
      "my best favorite game this game is just perfect. the only issue is the lack of gameplay smoothness and the server ping is far too high resulting in laggy gameplay.\n",
      "ive been playing the game for about a week now and i have to say that im impressed and very happy with the game so far. im not far into the story but its quite engaging and i keep putting down other games to play this one. the combat and magic system is pretty simple to follow but i havent unlocked the other ability systems yet. id like to add that i am sadly quite vain when it comes to games i like my games to look good as well as play good which this seems to have done.\n",
      "it the best game in the whole world it so much fun and it us fun when you can play with friends and you can chat with then and there are so many cool people in the game and how it first started it has a back story and it really fun but sometimes changes but in all it the best game to have and i think you should get this game\n",
      "things ive experience on my 4gig ram phone glowing water very bright that hurts my eyes no grass laggy no ice yes i can walk through water but no ice some characters faces were darkened like kaeyas fixed slow loading especially in domains delay movements sometimes dvalon and signoras model graphics fixed i do not blame mihoyo for this but please fix these problems for low end phone users like me i dont mind lowest graphics. i just want to enjoy this game. ty\n",
      "its one of the best game to play. artifact system just sucks tho. farming good artifacts for a single character can take weeks or months so 2 stars. the annoyance with it is that big.\n",
      "the adventure the game takes us is pretty intresting. and i really dont need to mention about the graphics and the details they are so catching.\n",
      "best game i played so far. i never found any interesting and great games as genshin impact. i love all the content. looking forward for more updates. but the only thing that makes me mad is i dont have enough storage to keep up...\n",
      "this game is a really fun game. my advice is that you take the game slowly and enjoy every second of it. do not rush content and do not fear of missing out content because the all come back later.\n",
      "the best game that a person can play as it provides you with a lot of characters and its world is very large and you can play with your friends and make your dream house in four different areas but if the beginners give more primo jam it will be the unbeatable game\n",
      "good game love the story and game play but sometimes i lag and also sometimes its hard to level up cause i cant easily get the items anyways can u make a free pyro character that is a sword user cause i hate amber but i love the rest of my characters. please make a boy wish come true \n",
      "better on pc.. i would love to play this game on mobile but after playing on pc i noticed how clunky the touch controls feel on android. i bought a razer kishi recently and am very upset to see that the developer hasnt allowed official controller support for android but has had controller support for ios for some time now the devs need to work on this asap it makes no sense why ios can have support but us android users are left out. until controller support comes i guess i wont be playing...\n",
      "this game is incredible one of the best gacha game that i never played every day there is something new that game is relaxant like if you are bored or something if you open genshin you can play for hours and hours and the caracteres are so handsome its not difficult to use you can learn a lit of things and for me she deserve at 100 the place in the best games of 2022 333\n",
      "honestly speaking i have had great times while playing this although being a f2p does sometimes make me feel restricted but i can live with that. probably the biggest complain that i have is for the mobile version only the character swapping ui is kinda confusing i ask that you make it like the pc version which the chracter profoles dont switch positions instead they stay this would make quick swapping a lot easier because i can remember the characters position.\n",
      "its feel like im in isekai very realistic anime themed so colorful and good animatian but sometime i get bug. like when in the dungeon i was stuck and defeated the boss 3x and replay the dialoge 3x too\n",
      "ive collected the chest in the and the treasure goes to... quest in co op mode but i didnt get the 40 promogems and other reward for completing the quest.can you fix it.\n",
      "its an interesting game that comes with its own far share of challenges and puzzles and the story line is great so far with all the side quest.\n",
      "very nice but i think you need to improve more when it comes to mobile cause some mobile users cant see grass... and youre gonna make a new region full of grass... i dont think ppl will like it when they see a flat surface which was supposed to be grass...\n",
      "genshin impact is a wondrous world of fantasy and is one of the best games i have ever played. the world building is absolutely fantastic the lore the story the characters all superbly well done. its incredible and i love it.\n",
      "i believe sumeru update is really really fantastic. the exploration experience and the facilities they put is really helpful. we didnt see much about the archon quest but making the patch period 5 weeks instead of 6 will solve that a bit. i cant describe how good the music is in sumeru because if you didnt listen to yourself youre missing a lot my friend. its just that good whether were talking about the battle or the world themes.\n",
      "my brother and i love this game to the point of playing and grinding almost everyday. my only issue is the customer support and account protection which is quite concerning. my brothers account got hacked recently for unknown reasons. we already tried sending in some proof and details we can remember but to no avail has it resulted in anything. we have supported this game from the very beginning so i hope that you will also do the same for us players.\n",
      "its really fun for a technically free game. would rate higher if there were more things to do in multiplayer outside events or even just more to do in single player because endgame gets old fast. for anyone considering this game do not top up. the welkin and battle passes are better for your money.\n",
      "its a really good game but im having a problem with the trails in tianqu quest and its other people as well. its almost impossie and the co op mode wont be available until i beat it. but i think it happens with other quests. so can you please add an abandon quest feature for the world quests \n",
      "now after 3 years the end game is the same old boring grind for artifacts for 30 mins morning and night. spiral abyss very low rewards even when the floors are harder now dps 1.5 mil hp within 2 mins and still this low reward primogems. specters are just bullet sponges and no mechanics. old and new players are not rewarded great in this game. old event weapons for the new players cant get them. resin system still bad recharge time as first release. wish they added permanent minigames for coop.\n",
      "i giving this a 5 cuz why not but ive been playing this game a long time like 9 months but the 3.0 update my game fps im playing on mobile kinda dropping and lagging its not the same as before my gb still has higher gb idk why the game having fps drop ive seen so many this issue from tiktok when the 3.0 update released so pls fix this \n",
      "i have been playing this game since its launch and there has not been a day where i missed logging in to this game on my pc. now that i have a decent gaming mobile phone playing this game on the go has been a great experience. the only thing that upsets me is that the android version does not have a controller support despite me seeing news that the ios supports it. i would appreciate it if you all develop a controller support for android as well to make the experience more immersive.\n",
      "lack of diversity racist sterotypes unappealing text reptitive quests style of them. i could go on but my main complaint is stealing pocs culture and not even bothering to add them or at least you will if you can fight them.\n",
      "nice game beautiful soundtracks interesting storyline but the new updates never seem to interest me anymore like how it used to but i really want the events to focused more on combat rather than making drinks etc never any new unique playstyles for any of the new characters the gacha system it sucks honestly 90 pity for a guaranteed 5 its not even the guaranteed banner character 160 primos for 1 pull its really a pain for f2p players\n",
      "i cant even start the game whenever i try to download the resources it always says insufficent storage yada yada ive cleared the cache and the data so many times. i dont know what to do. i have enough full storage for it \n",
      "its such a good game with a great concept but why are they just not listening to their community or give free stuff thats not the only problem they also need to fix certain characters that is not working as intended or was the character intentionally made like that like yoimiya cant trigger vaporize there is a cooldown and weapon banners should be fixed.\n",
      "i am in love this game so much but teg only problem is it takes too much amount of storage it took almost 25gb in my ipad now i understand that this is an open world role playing game and it sure need lot more graphics and all so no complains but in future when this game releases other 3 nations and a few updates its gonna take all my storage as my ipad only is 64 gb so please try to make game somewhat compressed so that it take less space atleast under 64gb\n",
      "okay i as disappointed as i am about the anniversary i still have to give this game credit. it is really cool and i enjoy playing it. definitely room for improvements but overall a really amazing f2p friendly game \n",
      "this game is outstanding the graphics the characters and everything just one problem. why does this app have to take up so much storage like it took up almost half of my storage when i just got my new phone \n",
      "blew me away yes it has minor things that it can fix but on your phone or computer dont matter. plays very nice dont believe me. check out my stream twitch.tv ancientgoosetv shameless plug and ill prove it. game is a lot of fun.\n",
      "really fun and probaly the best gacha game out right now the game has a lot great graphics story characthers and etc however the game does have some quality of life things they need such as weapon banner faiths carry over constellations toggle on or off and mainly having cross one account across the nation because for example if u make a account in america servers you cant have the same account if u switch servers\n",
      "outstanding graphic and details. high quality music and sfx. easy controls. well done plot and story between characters. of course bad gacha system.\n",
      "one of the best adventure game i ever played on mobile the graphic is beautiful open world with a huge map so many exploration and awesome storyline..\n",
      "fix xinyan fix amber fix electro element. stop making pay to win events. you are bringing way more banners so provide more primogems. fix the weapon banner system. listen to playerbase make the roadmap and fix the bugs. this game is a buggy mess in pc. and it sometimes creates bugs whenever windows 10 takes an update.\n",
      "a real good game really it worths my time however i am from india and i suffer through a lot of ping issue it may be because of server issue but even though if i keep that aside when fighting devalin or stormterror the first time while it fly i see some featers like thinks covering my screen and it lags can barely see him throughout the gameplay for aiming and shooting him\n",
      "great mmorpg game i think the fps still can be fix. the storyline is great but i hope theres not too much update. the actual requirement for this game is ram 4gb and 20gb free up space.\n",
      "i kinda love and hate it at the same time. the lore is great the new map and archon quest are awesome but i really dislike how certain element mainly geo is really bad. this game favors elemental reaction a lot but geo dont even have a good one its more apparent when you fight against enemies with elemental shield. edit this make me think that geo brings nothing gameplay wise. sent you feedbacks abt this but nothing has been done. im too disappointed upset to continue playing.\n",
      "except from the over sized storage its a great game many poeple say they played the game it sucks too me only for me to find out that they havent even pressed the install button. i think genshins mistake is making events that are more storyline related not that its a problem my friends complain that they played genshin for the itto event the bartender one etc i really wish for genshin to add more events that arent related to fighting but still its a great game \n",
      "i love the game. beautiful graphics and many amazing items and quests. my only problem is the lag which is to be expected and i can no longer level up. i dont know if anyone else is having this issue but it is a severe disadvantage to not level up especially if the soul of the game is to level up.\n",
      "the best game ive ever seen on mobile. gorgeous ambientation awesome characters and a fantastic story. just a little strict with f2p rewards but a great game overall.\n",
      "hi please fix it its been months there is still a bug where it suddenly closes the game while im playing on my phone vivo y20s g android 12. it happened 20 times already. i really love this game this problem is making not want to play . thank you kindly.\n",
      "ar 46 speaking here. this game is magnificent. i havent been this addicted to game if not this is the only game i have ever been enjoying and addicted to. i love this game. there are so many characters materials and stuff in the open world. so many puzzles mechanics and so much more. plus its free to install and its still higher quality than alot of rpg games. its hard to think of any complaint. i didnt really run across any problems i only lag if im fighting alot of stuffs 99 10 \n",
      "this is the most amazing game you could ever play in your life time. i have been playing this game since the very beginning it has got a great story line amazing characters zhongli my favourite character and its sooo much fun \n",
      "it would make me happy if you guys optimize low end device such as mobile i play on mobile the only time i can experience smooth gameplay is when i have to low everything at the lowest with 24 fps and off everything including anti aliasing and bloom it would make me happy if u guys would smooth it out for us low end device users.\n",
      "a really great game although my tablet cannot function genshin properly i cannot see ice when ice bridging damage so i cant damage test and i dont have grass too i also have a really low graphics i really love this game tho its not f2p friendly and alot of bugs to be fixed.\n",
      "this game is too awesome. its open world and just wow. you really can go anywhere. its really engaging. you can play ftp all you want. i did for a whole year. am now buying welkin pack and its pretty much all i need.\n",
      "a beautiful looking game amazing open world experience avaliable on a phone. but very repetitive and unwelcoming to newer players in later parts.\n",
      "the game is fun its open world and its a gacha game but really you should be more giving give us a free 5 star for every anniversary in genshin make tiny events that give 100 primos instead of 40 or 60 make players happy by giving them free stuff otherwise the game is fun to play but please be more giving to low ar players they need it.\n",
      "the game is great it has good combat good story and good exploration. however it does take a while to progress. i think the developers did this on purpose to make you try to explore every little detail which is a good idea its just not that fun to do. or its just a way to make you spend more time on the game. well if you are fine with spending hours grinding and maybe even spending money for the gacha then i think youll still rather enjoy this game.\n",
      "its an amazing game but the crashing and lagging for mobile is awful plus it takes almost 10 minutes just to get into the game.\n",
      "this game has a lot of potential great music lore style . issues bad communication with the players not acknowledging issues that have been in the game since day 1 very little new permanent content. edit still the same as above almost a year later. character design and voice direction issues. with character designs of sumeru region skin tones mostly white but npcs of colour not using cultural elements that could make designs much better. voice direction some mischaracterising.\n",
      "bad support ive had an issue with my account for over 8months and the support is still unable to fix it. terrible support. 9months later still the same issues. still terrible support to this day.\n",
      "this game will need a pvp ill play tower of fantasy when they release it just for that reason . i dont want to leave genshin impact behind but you guys need to be more competitive. more friendly with f2p players . you guys need a big change .\n",
      "recently came back to genshin and am slowly getting back into rhythm so my take its a nice game if you want to collect things or indulge in story if you like to explore or enjoy loads of combat. i play on mobile and unlike a lot of these reviews i dont experience any lag. reruns come quite often with powerful characters getting reruns every other update theres no reason to complain about not being able to get older characters. i recommend to just try for yourself you might be surprised.\n",
      "its a really well designed action rpg. everything from the environment to the bgm will draw you in and then theres the characters themselves that are so well designed and voiced that it should be a crime because they will temp you to empty your wallet for them. if you want to be f2p some self control is required as well as making some hard choices on which 5 star you want. you will need at least a 200 phone to run this game and even better for the best experience.\n",
      "nice game good graphics but dvalin would glitch on me and i only see random shapes that cover up my screen so its hard for me to fight the boss same goes for certain characters but i still like it sucks though that i cant play it on my pc i would wish for the dvalin visual bugged to be fixed or at least get reduced so fighting dvalin wont be too much of a hassle\n",
      "this game is really fun especially when you play with your friends almost all of the characters are cool and very fun to play with mid difficulty on level up.\n",
      "im obsessed with genshin impact but i feel like its hard to get good charecters as a f2p. this game is 5 stars tho because this game is amazing with great graphics and adorable characters kleeeeeeee genshin if you see this klee rerun pls lol. edit thank you genshin for the klee rerun i got her and not only is she adorable but also really helpful anyways i would definitely recommend this game.\n",
      "one of the best games i have ever played. the storyline is great the gameplay and even just the music makes me feel good the game also looks beautiful. the grinding isnt too tedious there is only one thing. you have to optimize the graphics. i am playing on a 128 gb samsung tablet and lots of space but it still says its overclocked. besides that great game \n",
      "i give the game 4 star. its all good but only problem is the bugs when i have smooth graphics. still a wonderful game i suggest you guys play on pc or tablet.\n",
      "personally i love the game. unfortunately ive been overwhelmed with all the mechanics in this game. also ive seen way too many similarities with breath of the wild. fix you f ing game c \n",
      "this is a masterpiece. very good mobile game something i notice and its annoying was enemy on spiral abbys sometimes doesnt spawn quickly. it wasted 10 sec after the timer countdown. my star gone bcoz if this bug. i hope hoyoverse team fix this asap\n",
      "its a good game it does require a lot of grinding though so if your looking for a game you can just pick up and come back to every few months this isnt it constant farming just to progress. dont rush everything though the story is pretty much the only thing making the game anything other than just farming. if you rush through it youll be bored out of your mind waiting for more content and places to explore besides the event every now and then. its a great game though and i really enjoy it\n",
      "genshin has a cool story and characters as well as a nice combat sytem big exploration and puzzles. but when it comes to listening to players on the problems we have with the game we get nothing. i love this game but i hate that they take from other peoples cultures and appropriate it sumeru so far and im scared for the next countries. they put so much research into east asia but not the middle east end game is really boring but you lose out in events that require being caught up so bruh\n",
      "im done with this game artifacts stats drop from domain are 99.9 garbage. even if you have a nice roll of initial stats when upgraded they mostly upgraded to hp def atk elem . im changing my rate from 2stars to just 1star. uninstall.\n",
      "i been playing for a while and it gets repetitive cause of the ar lock i have a hard time doing quest and its extremely laggy my wifi is ok and my phone is decent but on low graphics its super laggy great story but hard to play\n",
      "this game is very interesting overall i think that some phone graphics are not really good. i cannot see how much damage i take whenever i hit the enemies. theres no grass and the water is glowing whenever i go so far from the water i can always see the water glowing.\n",
      "though my phone can barely support good quality in this game it is a beautiful game theres so many things to do so you wont ever have to just sit around. i do wish the pity on the banners would be lower but other than that this game is great\n",
      "absolutely a masterpiece. from visuals voiceovers story lore characters animations and graphics music everything.\n",
      "the game is good nice graphics great gameplay etc. the only problem is account security. improve your security please. yesterday my account got hacked and i cant do anything to it same with my hoyoverse account. the player support also needs some work. several hours later i saw my account in a russian buy sell website. to be honest im absolutely pissed right now because i wasted hours and hours of grinding the game just for someone to hack it and make profit off of it.\n",
      "the only downsides to the game is that it is not available on the microsoft store and you have to download it through google chrome and after you download it you have to wait like 30 minutes to actually get to play it not to mention you cant sign up with a google account when you start to play on computer when you signed up with google on your phone\n",
      "i played this game when it first came out it was a little wonky i found a lot of glitches actually but in the end new updates and new everything i couldnt use it pretty often because my phone was too bad but now i have a new phone and everything that i see is so good it has changed its new and more updated\n",
      "i have been playing this game since version 2.0 and have been enjoying this a lot. i have a low end mobile and even then i like this game a lot. only problem is the size of the game. the new update of 2.7 is of 9 gb and i cant afford to update it dur to storage issues. it only mihoyo did something to cut the space of previous cut scenes that cannot be accessed. i really hope they do something for mobile players.like we can delete voice over that we dont need we should be given this for other\n",
      "i have two strong opinions about this game. one the graphics and the sheer quality of the open world is amazing. most of us if not all of us would come to a general consesus that in terms of gameplay storyline and character lore genshin is quite a spectacle. second the endgame itself is essentially non existent as getting to a certain point would only hinder their progress or would make the players question their play time. if so is there a way to communicate for system changes \n",
      "i personally like it and its very entertaining i gave it a four because it generally is really good its just that it does get a boring after a while but when new events come out its is more fun and i sometimes forget why we are traveling in the world so over all its a good game\n",
      "i love the game at first i had an account where i was stuck on a specific place and it really sucked but now i am further on a diff acc and i just needed a little break anywasys 5 5 or 9 10 would definitely recommend \n",
      "the music and graphics are very well put together and beautiful. there are many small details that make the game even more enjoyable. each character design is different and well thought. the plot is also interesting. there are times where it can get frustrated but overall i really recommend this game. many different skills and different game play. if you like rpg and open world games i 100 percent recommend this game.\n",
      "so the game is very good the graphics are amazing if u play on pc although in phone is also pretty good however it would be better if the game could provide us with an easier way of obtaining primogems since there are a lot of f2p players and we kinda struggle a lot with getting primogems to pull for characters but overall a very amazing game and actually a game that can be played for free although u need to have a lot of patience \n",
      "i loved this game a lot at first but the more i played the slower it got. it started freezing while i was battling and it got to where i couldnt switch characters while fighting. at this point its pretty much unplayable. i tried to defeat a boss and kept dying because the game was so glitchy i couldnt tell what was happening then it wouldnt let me teleport away so i was stuck there. i couldnt even get out of the app and had to restart my device. i have an android.\n",
      "honestly its fun looks great and is addicting. could be more enemies but im in the early map parts. the combat is solid and switching between characters is easy and fast. definitely give it a try only real complaint is i cant get my xbox controller to work and it has a key bindings setting.\n",
      "been playing since day one. the main storyline is amazing and the lore deep. at end game can get boring waiting for new content but many months of fun before you reach that.\n",
      "from what ive been able to play its been fun. but i downloaded the game and had like 15 minutes of resources to download. played for an hour or so came back later to another 7 minutes of downloads. this game is nuts with downloading more resources. i have limited time to play games i cant spent 30 minutes watching downloads after spending 30 minutes downloading only to play for 15 minutes and have another 7 minute download. you guys gotta stop with the downloads.\n",
      "i absolutely love this game. the plot is amazing plus i love the characters. this is a wonderful adventure game. however when i first got the game it took a long time to get everything ready. but over all i think this is a wonderful game.\n",
      "i absolutely love this game with all my heart but recently had to quit since my phone could not handle it. the new update also takes a whole bunch of space i dont have. i would definitely recommend this game but make sure you have a device that can handle the high quality graphics as lag can be a problem on mobile.\n",
      "i love this game but they double charged my account when i bought extra primogems. i tried to contact them through the game through the feedback option but only got an error message. when i contacted google to request my refund they gave it to me so i assumed the mistake was their fault. my refund was fraudulent but still got an error message when i tried to contact them again. if i wanted 30 worth of primogems i wouldnt have bought two 15 packages but the 30 which had bonuses.\n",
      "i know theres lots of things people complain about this game but some of those one star reviews are kind of pointless just someone mad about something small so heres a five star rating to counter it if you think about it this game is a aaa game for free a story the plot everything sure that grinding sucks sometimes and the gotcha system but i played games in the tomb raider series and this game is so similar just play for the story and have a good time you dont need every character\n",
      "i love this game the graphics are perfect story is perfect and its also a cool adventure game you can play with friends or with other people too \n",
      "its a great game but i dont know why i cant watch any of the cutscene. even though i put all low in graphics. it only show one frame of the cut scene and it freeze the sound also lagging. been playing this for a while now im at inazuma and i still cant watch any of this cutscene. i hope you can find solution about this.\n",
      "the best game i dont play after you learn to how to level yourself up and completely learn how to level your character and it becomes challenging and fun at the same time\n",
      "its an amazing game really and im not some random bot saying this the game has great graphics and the animation of it is so good i even downloaded it on my ps4. if the graphics arent good on ur phone download it on ur ps and if u dont have one then im sorry but this game is really amazing and im addicted to it this will definitely me help through the summer \n",
      "while many parts of the game deserve praise still there are a few problems. one being some characters are considerably weak even compared to even less worthy counterpart s indirect buffs may not really fit in as they reduce the flexibility of the characters . another is the artifacts which takes so much time to just get decent ones for a single character and new characters keep arriving. finally wish all the developers be safe and sound during hard time.\n",
      "this is the best game ive payed so far. my only thing to say is that the resin amount for the day is quite small. especially the condensed resin amount which is only 5x. i wish they could make it to 15x condensed resin and 200 240 original resin.\n",
      "man this is awesome. especially an anime lover will definitely like it but on top of that the graphics in the game are really extraordinary. well i can understand the hard work done by the developers and i really appreciate them for this fabulous work \n",
      "i would give it 5 stars or even 100 stars if possible but theres one thing that kinda brings it down to a 4 star review. the thing is that whenever a cut scene appears it starts to glitch alot and sometimes you cant even enjoy the story line becuase of the cut scenes keeps on lagging and im not really surprised about it becuase im playing on mobile and usually games work better on tablets pc but if its possible could you fix it but apart from the cut scenes lagging the game is fantastic \n",
      "i played the game for like 500 days...and already reached ar 58...but im quite disappointed with my artifact roll...to get a good artifact was already hard for me...and to upgrade it also doesnt grant me a chance to get a good substat...i hope u can fix this...just increase the chances of getting a good artifact with a good substat. thank you.\n",
      "a good game that i would recommend playing has some nice story lore but there are some issued that ive encountered. character texture glitch is still not yet fixed like stormterror signora yun jin and raiden shogun on domain. but the first three that i said is fix able but raiden shogun in true form cannot be fixed. hoping for yall to see and fix this issue. its very annoying and affects players experiences especially when they need materials to level up their weapons and characters.\n",
      "every good thing in the genshin can be covered with a bad one and most of them are able to be fixed. interesting storyline but the plot kinda undone too childish and there are many non logical holes in it. great graphics no low capacity settings. beautiful and bright characters oversexualised anthopomorphicly looking women half of them in fu ing underwear. sexualisation here take really big part like we do not know age of any exact loli body type girls. pedophile heaven\n",
      "recently returned to the game while this game is undoubtedly still the best mobile game it lacks what it once did at launch. theres nothing in the game that has been left in intentionally to wonder about. maybe the release was incomplete and those mysterious areas later added was unintentional but it was those puzzling areas i enjoyed the most. its missing that now making it less about adventuring and exploration when theres no discoveries to be made beyond the quests.\n",
      "it has been months since i started genshjn and even though with what happened with the anniversary drama and all i am very grateful for this game for changing my life. got into am artblock for months and was going through a boring and bad time thankfully this game both saved me and my time. even though there are issues with the bugs resin shortage artifact problems and story pacing for a free game . . its already very very amazing cant type long but it deserves a 5 star review \n",
      "i love this game but im about to delete it. its gotten to the point that the game crashes as soon as it loads and makes it past the loading screen. if im lucky and it does play its lagging and slow to catch up unless you stand completely still for 5 minutes even then the problem isnt solved. if youre lucky enough to continue playing it through the lag then as soon as you enter combat it crashes. its a fun game but i spend more time waiting than playing.\n",
      "there are not many games that ive stuck with after an entire calendar year of playing but genshin has made that list. im about to hit month 14 ar58 and i still play daily. there are many improvements i wish the developers would bring. bugs that have been around since early game quality of life fixes players have asked for time and again. but overall the game is highly enjoyable and something you can enjoy for the long haul.\n",
      "i really like playing the game because it has alot of characters enemies and items. im already obsessed on the game because the graphics was sooooooooooooo good and the regions are really fun to explore. i gave this a 5 star since i know this game works hard and its a really fun. the only thing i hate is toxic player \n",
      "its been two days and the recources still havent loaded. how am i supposed to play the game look i get it takes time to load but i left my phone off hoping it to load the next day and it did nothing it was the same amount. it was dissapointing.\n",
      "very enjoyable love the game although it gets harder with the higher levels and sometimes u cant go on unless someone helped you with opening the map in co.op mode nevertheless i like it\n",
      "i stopped playing for a month now. this is an amazing game its hard to find ones like it. the reason it gets 2 stars is because of how little male characters there are. its not even dismissable the comparison of male and female characters ratio. the fandom is also toxic if u say anything negative. i love the game and i will get back when the new region gets added. i will always love this game 3 please consider us who like male characters.\n",
      "im currently playing the game on ps4. although its available on the phone i highly recommend you play on pc or console. its just not the same experience. the graphics are beautiful and theyre a ton of things to do. most complaints are with the mobile version. i tried and the game is so large and requires so much power my phone was uncomfortably hot during load.\n",
      "this game is awesome. the fighting is so cool and the graphics are like the chefs kiss. but one minor complaint. it takes so long to load i installed this game in the morning cuz it looked awesome. 6 hours later i am still waiting for it to load but it is definitely worth the wait to see the awesome graphics and the gameplay is great. overall this is an outstanding game and i totally recommend it to anyone who wants to get it.\n",
      "the game is reeeally beatiful and graphics are amazing even for mobile. in game sound effects and music are very great the best ive ever seen. intresting storyline pretty character design and the greattttest voice acting. if you are choosing to play or not play u will not regret minuses economy in game is welllllll not so bad but not so good. very simple to play without donut but better with it\n",
      "i really really like this game its fun all the characters are really cool the storyline is awesome i like almost everything about this game. lisa keeps dying lol my reason for four stars is because the controls are a little wonky on mobile. ive fallen off cliffs five times because for some reason my characters go in full circles before actually turning around. but other than that i love this game and i wont be bored its like a mixture between skyrim and kingdom hearts and i love it\n",
      "can be a bit laggy but i blame my phone for that more than anything. graphics and story telling are amazing and i wish i could download the background music and listen to it everywhere. the open world format is refreshing to have in a mobile game and navigation through the world is rather easy when you are familiar with open world format. im really excited to see what will be done with the game next.\n",
      "this is one of the best android games ive played in ages. worth all the time. keep it up edit changed my rating to 1 as with new update cant login to my account. works fine on pc.\n",
      "amazing game i love the character design lore fighting styles wishing etc. but i did rated a 4 star instead because that on my phone samsung galaxy a51 i still dont know if it happens for other phones but when there would be a scene like the stormterror being summoned its always laggy for context it would glitch and the characters talking is glitched also but on my computer its all fine. if theres any way to fix this please try to. thank you \n",
      "its great it has a bit of everything in it. you can style your house pot farm fish wish for characters fight and so much more it has the juiciest story line too 3 dont worry you can also play with friends or strangers. words can say how good this game is but i can try this game makes me a simp. the best thing is.. no ads honestly the download wait is worth it \n",
      "im having an issue after the recent update. i cant see the message of my friends that theyve sent me but i can see the small red notification. when i try to message someone my message is gone when i try to exit from the chat box\n",
      "this game is surely addictive and u have to spend money if u want most of the characters. its definitely hardest game to pull characters. even if u spend money there is chance that u wont get what you want. dont download this or else ull regret\n",
      "in my opinion the game is amazing i love the graphtand the storyline too but leveling up your characters is very hard...you need to play over and over and over so you can level up characters this game need two things...no.1 more characters you can play with and no.2 need character costuming. overall i really love the game.\n",
      "its a very good game and ive been playing since 2.3 had a lot of fun so far only issue in my opinion is that the later into the game you get the more difficult it becomes to really stay engaged in the story and find things to do that will really keep you entertained while playing the only real reason i still stick around in this is for my characters ive gotten which may be the best part of the game. the grind for strong characters.\n",
      "i love this game so much but a have a problem the resin now that you update 2.8 you add a new hero and upcoming sumeru to many domain less resin.hoyoverse you should change the resin system thats the only problem in this game.dont worry i change my rating if my problem has been solve.thank you for the hard work \n",
      "really beautiful game. the only downside is that you need a highly powerful device run it on android. my tablets antutu score is nearly 492000 but still it starts to get warm after 1.5 to 2 hrs of continuous gaming.\n",
      "everythings amazing except for the enemy drops its always delayed and most of the time dont drop anything... and thats on world 8 which supposed to have higher drop rates \n",
      "great gameplay characters story art... the only thing would be that its a bit difficult for free to play characters to make a desired team. if there were more opportunities to get primogems i think the game would be more enjoyable for everyone \n",
      "this game has beautiful graphics an indepth storyline and very enjoyable combat mechanics. there is a lot of content to always keep me busy when i want to play games. building characters and different team compositions is very fun. however i would like there to be some way to guarantee a good artifact by having some kind of pity system for artifact substats just like there is for character and weapon banners \n",
      "the game is great its just the amount of farming and greediness of primogems. everything is a bit complicated at the start and its exciting but it could even take you up to more than a week to grind 1600 primogems or sometimes even less than that just for 10 spins and a short animation. im not surprised that a big game like this has a lot of purchasable in game items for real money. but at least increase primogems by a bit. but still overall the game is good.\n",
      "better all game and good inspiration of zelda. my device is capable to run smoothly.since it runs smoothly but create too much of heat since im just in start menu loading screen its starts too much of heat in my device since there no background running app .so please consider my problem and since you optimize smoothly it is to be appreciated but also think about heating of mobile devices . you should help as to overcome this problem . other then that its wonder and amazing good .thanks \n",
      "overall one of the best games that your able to play on mobile a open world map with multiple characters to main once you play it more it gets easy and fun to play \n",
      "fun game ive spent hours playing and loved the story and awesome visuals only problem is how much storage space it takes up and as of the 2.7 update i had to remove alot of apps so i could download the extra 8.1 gb for it which makes me wonder how much is going to be needed for future updates and if my phone is going to be able to keep up.\n",
      "screw all the one star reviews. the game is amazing in all term ive seen in open world games. the scenery is beautiful and the physical attraction gives you characters of every body type and personality and fighting style. all players only ever care about getting stronger not about following the storyline or admiring the game appreciating the time it took to make it. the physics of the hair and dresses clothing are phenomenal and there are so few bugs. the character stories are moving aswell\n",
      "im not one to take interest in mobile games at all but when genshin impact captured my eye i certainly like this game more likely because of the characters and the soundtracks. everything is beautiful for a game thats also on mobile its impressive to see that its still compatible pc and ps4 is great to i play on three . everything is amazing so far i do wish that it can add more shortcuts on mobile like it is on pc to make it easier for us mobile players.\n",
      "overall the best game out there beautiful sceneries superb soundtracks a well built main story op game mechanics last but not the least open world.... theres gacha system to get your fav characters but saving primos is a bit tough for a f2p.... also if youve got a good specs device then no prob else youll be missing out some crystal clear beautiful sceneries.... i would highly recommend this game and see if its to your taste.\n",
      "regarding 2.7 patch.. im so freaking speechless in the new archon quest if there are words i can describe the latest patch its without a doubt overwhelmingly amazing breathe taking great animations the cutscenes and cinematics you will really know that the comapny put a lot of effort hoyoverse are living up to his reputation. great story plot unlike those generic mmorpg game since now and then a lot of plot twists makes me fell in love with the game over and over again.\n",
      "great story and open world may get a bit stale at times when playing but overall a great experience especially when a new archon or world quest drops \n",
      "total embarrassment. ive played every day since launch. i spent hundreds on this game thinking they valued their player base. i was wrong. they couldnt spare to give the players a little more out of appreciation for all the support we gave them. 10 intertwined fates log in event same rewards as a previous event. lets not forget they used to give us daily log in bonuses that gave us 300 gems a while back but that mysteriously stopped. i dont feel inclined to spend anymore. thanks mihoyo.\n",
      "i havent tried it yet because it just shows me the loading screen and it wont even let me in ive waited hours for it but im on android tho if that helps edit i think i figured out how to fix the mistake but i still havent played the game yet so once i do ill give the full review but thank you for your concern\n",
      "the game is 10 10 on pc however the mobile version should use some work its extremely laggy even with everything at its lowest settings my best guess is the character models have too many polygons for a mobile device to render yet im not a programmer. id suggest to play this on your computer if you have one cause it runs much better on there.\n",
      "the game is amazing with graphics character variety and combat mechanics. so much to discover in this massive open world game. devs are consistently improving in exploration and world expansion which is nice. however this game lacks quality daily routine content and end game content after you finish all exploration and story quests. not much to do on a daily basis when u finish. thus leaving you to just do small events often waiting for big updates and events to come every few weeks.\n",
      "a gotcha game that is actually worth playing for once. it is possible to get almost everything with a bit of grinding and certain characters are fun to have but are not required. a free and beautiful game with freedom of movement similar to breath of the wild. a good game for large phones and tablets and constantly updated however the current file size as of review date is 15gb give or take. i prefer it on pc but its great for other platforms too \n",
      "this game is the best game i have ever played. all the characters design are amazing and the story is interesting. plus its an open world where you can explore and have an adventure freely i really like the graphics. keep up the good work and continue to make amazing characters and cool stories \n",
      "i love this game ive been fixating on it for a few months and my partner bought me a welkin for it too my only problems is that materials are really hard to get and the game can get a bit repetitive and the materials you have to get just get harder and harder to achieve. the combat is pretty hard as well and can get overwhelming. it also runs terribly on my phone but slightly better playable at least on my ipad and flawlessly on my pc. definitely need good graphics for this. love it tho 3\n",
      "i loved the game but its a money pit trying to get characters you want. the wishing isnt fair unless your rich. and trying to join co op with friends with only 3 spots might as well expect to play alone.\n",
      "this game is wonderful so far as a humble traveler i really recommend this game although i may have high expectations for now.. i heard the gacha in this game has some troubles but i hope that will improve on the future update although as much as i love this game i cant really view the cutscenes properly cause of the lag and it can be irritating sometimes. it did made a huge improvement at sometimes but i have to lock my screen in order for it to not glitch out.\n",
      "love the game definitely one of the best in play store but please please please fix the cutscenes. i literally cant watch any because its having a brain freeze like why is that even a thing why do the cutscenes freeze im pretty sure there are countless others who have writin this similar comment but please just please fix this. itll definitely make everyones game play feel more smooth and not like we are all playing on a device thats made of rock or wood.\n",
      "a very good game with high quality and massive crazy and amazing landscapes lots of puzzles and a very balanced story monthly updates i played it 24 7 till i sadly finished it. update its been around three months that im now playing it theres no endgame content game forces you to do your daily actions and then youre gone until tomorrow events rewards are getting worse and worse and worse i have to drop my rating by 2 \n",
      "the graphics rich storyline open world exploration and overall experience is great. yes it takes up alot of space but thats all the effort put into this great of a game.. 3 character artworks and designs are beautiful nobody pays much attention to this but the soundtracks are extraordinary as well. d\n",
      "this game is amazing the graphics and character animations are so smooth the cutscenes have so much detail and i mean everything is just picture perfect. amazing game hoyo. but please for the love of god about the cutscenes fix the glitches. please.\n",
      "a truly beautiful game even on the lower graphics settings its graphics are better than most games ive played on mobile before. it runs smoothly has great voice acting and an amazing story i would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in adventure games.\n",
      "i have heard alot of this game i really love it if you ask me. but i dont believe this is a problem i have downloaded the game but when i put the puzzle in his place it says something like username or password error and when i press the loading screen it says i need to delete more apps. well i did. but i really love the game so i wouldnt say that is a real problem. but keep up the good work x\n",
      "i love this game.i had an issue and the customer support was great replied in minutes oh and i found a bu feature that i want to be left in the game.if you bounce of a person you dont receive fall damage.its a cool bu feature.\n",
      "good rpg game but with a fair amount of anime cringe that you have to tolerate as well as a gacha system but the entire game can be played free to play and the gacha mechanics are never really forced onto the player. they also seemingly improved performance with the 2.8 update\n",
      "the graphics are excellent its really fun and amazing playing with characters with different personalities and playstyles i also love the vast world and different monsters and bosses the storyline is astonishingly well made i love this game so much \n",
      "i have been noticing ever since the last 2.5 patch update the game is lagging a bit too frequently. i had gotten used to the small stutters and lags honestly thats something all mobile players have to go through but honestly theres a limit to it. especially after the fact that it used to run smooth before. its worse in 2.6 my phone is overheating the game is crashing withing mere 30mins of playing. please fix this.\n",
      "still a good game though i only use mobile for purchases and primarily play on pc. i wish the game didnt time gate as much and expanded the ability to play more at the users own pace regardless of how fast it slow theyd like to go through content but understand the game is still in development and this may not be feasible at this time. i hope they do consider increasing resin improving drop rates and attribute rates on artifacts and updating the standard banner as the game matures.\n",
      "in patch 2.8 my genshin started have a few complications.. it uninstalled itself and it had a whitescreen after the hoyoverse logo.. i have the right specs for the game yet it doesnt allow me to see the main menu how do i fix this \n",
      "it always crashes and i wasted more than 5 hours of my life trying to download 15 gb and when i enter the game super lag and i havent even moved a bit itll freeze and crash oh and it spreads to your other apps too. i deleted half of my games and when i enter any of my games itll crash.i cant even play my other games anymore even this\n",
      "the game play is accurate but the pictures and ads portray the gameplay itself as very clear. the game is very blurry for mobile and at the best settings very pixelated.. im told this wasnt always the case how do i fix the graphics to match the advertisements shown i have a pretty high end phone as well snap dragon 888 with 12 gb ram i dont know what else it could be. if the graphics were fixed this would be an easy 4 stars maybe 5.\n",
      "hello this game is my favourite game rn before i start though theres one thing that you should take into consideration before getting genshin. one of them is how much storage it takes up this cant really be changed but i do think that its a game you can only really have if you dont have many other apps i use a chromebook . otherine i think its ridiculous that this game it free definitely reccomend for a great story similar to an anime but with more control \n",
      "the game is fun overall the character are all well design the maps is nice the storyline is nice to. but i guess had one problem eversince the brand new update 2.3 my genshin impact started to get slow... i cant even tell if i already kill my opponent other than that after 2.4 update my graphic getting worser... mihoyo please help me\n",
      "hoyoverse takes inspiration from cultures around the world yet there is very little representation in body types and especially skin tone which is unacceptable. even the darkest characters are only slightly brown and are few and far between.\n",
      "one of the best game i played but there are several issues that hinders me to enjoy the game a lot. i have fps issues and the grass ice bridge and damage text are invisible looks like the it is too big for my device to see it. anw thanks for fixing glitch bugs on yunjin dvalin and signora \n",
      "the companys so stingy and its interesting like really but it feels more like an errand instead of a game. its creative and it has this potential but the developers are limiting it to just a really small box. istg 2.8 is trash\n",
      "the game itself would get 5 . mobile version loses 2 stars for 2 big faults. 1 have to reload if you turn your screen off and then back on. very bad for battery and sanity . 2 no controller support for mobile version. just why its cross play co op and controllers are able to pair with smart phones. again why \n",
      "pretty great the story is amazing but the lack of diversity between playable characters is concerning but all in all it deserves a 4.5 \n",
      " i love this game theres so much content thats absolutely free to play. you can literally spend 0 and wont run out of things to do for years. thanks for not pressuring my wallet although id be lying if i said i didnt enjoy an occasional blessing of the welkin moon \n",
      "graphics is good and gameplay is also good. the story is also really interesting and i cant wait for the next one to arrive hoyoverse have been generous enough with the primogems that they have provided for f2p players. the characters in the game are also really good however i only gave a 4 star due to drop rate of the artifacts cause its way too low hopefully itll be fixed or updated in the near future\n",
      "hey guys. why is your serenitea pot has limitation in plotting furnitures what is the essence of having a set of furnitures if they have limitations do you want us to just pick 1 set kind a weird huh. can you do something about it maybe you could remove the counts whenever you already placed them so that we could placed another set. well the number of items to be put in an island is reasonable but this thing needs to be fixed. that is why you have creation tool from tubby right \n",
      "the game is very exciting and fun. it is very enjoyable game because you can experience fantasy life and entertaining especially when you have friends or someone to play it together. however i hope you can find a way to reduce the game size. it consume so much space that im considering it to uninstall. thats all. thank you.\n",
      "this game is amazing i love the storyline and the characters but it has been so laggy recently. during the first few patches it ran very smoothly even with medium or high settings but now it lags and its so difficult to finish timed events since it takes about 10 20 seconds for the enemies to even load. please optimise it for android devices this game is so lovely and i dont want to quit it due to the lag.\n",
      "due to my game experience somehow theres black screen things that appear on my gameplay it appears when i fight swim or move and my surroundings are colorful and filled with glowy things and somehow cant see and sometimes it just go rainbow style it also happens to the characters where there face goes invisible when playing. i dont really know if my phone is affecting the game or the game is but im trying to fix it by updating my phone again but it still is a good game \n",
      "have been playing this game ever since release and i love it. sure it crashes rarely but that just depends on your storage and the type of phone you have. i only play on my phone when im traveling but i mostly play on my pc which is a much better experience. i love the character designs and events and how much i get to explore and interact with everyone and learn so much about the story and i cant wait to explore the rest of the nations when they come out. thank you genshin \n",
      "no cross server data sharing seriously i hate this type server management. gameplay is lacking with qol change no manual target lock so your targeting enemies will be messed with when there is a lot of enemies surround you. on pc playing with controller only work like 70 because there is no seamlessly transfer between mnk to controller and vice versa. controller doesnt work when in main menu.\n",
      "one of the greatest free to play games out there. a fantastic cast of characters an enjoyable story and a very unique and fun combat system. the gacha system is rather kind too as its not too difficult to get whoever you want as long as you save up. the only thing keeping this from being 5 stars is the co op as it is quite lacking and leaves a lot to be desired. otherwise an incredible game with lots to do. building your own living space combat exploration and enjoying the lore. try it \n",
      "i played like years ago using my email but got bored during the tutorial and uninstalled. i started playing again yesterday and got adventure rank lvl9 but after i unlocked a new character and tried to share to facebook for the extra reward the game crashed and i got sent back to the save point when i first played the game years ago. and now whenever i try to login it gives me network errors. it was fun but i really dont want to have to restart.\n",
      "the game is awesome i love the graphics the controls are easy to understand and overall the gameplay itself is very smooth and fun. i have been wanting to play an anime openworld for long i downloaded this and now im happy. but i would like you to add controller support for android as aiming is very hard so please add controller support for android\n",
      "i do really enjoy this game i have loads of fun playing it can be glitchy at times but that is to be expected with such a large game on mobile. i have also got stuck in a few walls which is obviously annoying but not the end of the world all in all its a fun game thats free to download and i really would recommend it \n",
      "amazing game but please give us an option which graphic level to download. the option to download delete voice files is not enough to clear more space for pur devices. the huge size is understandable but please letting us choose a lighter graphic option would not only increase genshins players but also still give some space for other apps in our phone. remember not everyone has huge storage in their phones.\n",
      "i may have run out of content for the time being but i got a few hundred hours of amazing open world anime delight from genshin. like equivalent to 2 or 3 triple a titles. i spent some money for a few characters i liked but could of had the same amazing gameplay experience without spending a dime. beware if you have poor impulse control. however there is no pay to win only pay to simp.\n",
      "the game is very fun to play and when something does go wrong or is an inconvenience they are very generous and dont make the game a hassel about whatever is interfering. i highly recommend this game. even for beginners its easy to understand plenty to do freely and just all out fun and is continuously growing.\n",
      "ive been playing for 2 months or so and so far everythings been great a very open world game with alot of things to do. a quest based gameplay which doesnt force you to do it so its a very do what you want to do game which i like. the main story is fluid and is entertaining. the characters have great designs and very exctied for more of them to come. very excited to where the developers will take the game and i hope its for the better\n",
      "to all of the new players out there wanting to install this gacha game i could tell you that it is an amazing game with lots of grinding and farming. the graphics is good the characters are good but some are trash. the storyline is great but i felt so underwhelmed with the recent archon quest. i would totally recommend to not spend any money on this game. but it is up to you to spend your entire fortune or not. overall it is still a great gacha game \n",
      "i pretty like this game. the graphics was awesome and the storyline is great every quest is challenging and fun. this will test your logical and problem solving skill.they are generous with the rewards and wont require you to spend much money which is very considerate. the map is massive and every place is unique i love how the developers pour their passion and creativity in this game. i hope in my next life i could experience being on the same team developing such awesome software. \n",
      "ive loved this game for over a year now i used to play daily. so much drew me in. but the characters designs are getting increasingly predictable boring and in some cases orientalist or racist. do better.\n",
      "fix enkanomiya please when i try to do anything in the region especially combat the entire screen flashes and stutters multiple times making the game basically unplayable. this only happens in enkanomiya for me and if its happening to others this glitching can be dangerous to people who are sensitive to flashing lights idk if its my device or the game but please fix the lag in the new region.\n",
      "i edited this for 5th times now but this game keeps getting better i really love the graphics of this game its very detailed and theres some glitched that makes me laugh at the time fun and sus characters and fun adventure moments with some of the playable characters and non playable characters so i just wanted to say they should remove the pre install pack because it just wastes more storage.\n",
      "i used to love genshin but this is getting ridiculous. pretty much every system in the game needs to change from money to genesis crystal ratio to earning primogems to every reward you get ever not being worth anything in the long run to money being the only way you get what you want in this game. it looks pretty and the gameplay is smooth if youre on a good device with good internet. but the character variety is lacking only 2 poc characters and decent artifacts are once in a blue moon.\n",
      "amazing graphics amazing story really good customer care but now the game is beginning to feel repetitive. i have yet to farm a full set of best possible artifacts for any of my characters despite being at ar55. its like the game is bugged to give artifacts with bad stats so that people will keep playing. i suggest you either remove this bad rng for artifacts or remove the resin system as its becoming impossible to get the artifacts we want. you do not strive to give the best experience.\n",
      "i really like this game. this game has a very engaging story and unique characters. but you need a large storage and compatible phone for the game. and today it keep crashing after updating the game and i reinstall it 3 times and its still doesnt work and i also rebooted my phone but the result still the same. pls help\n",
      "i love everything. but the game is getting more stale by the second that makes me unmotivated to do the newer content. the artifact system is very reliant on rng even more than characters weapon banner is worse than artifact tho . i wish the game can give us a choice on what artifact that can drop on a domain. not like stats just the type of artifact. for example i have been farming ittos artifacts for a long time but i only get ocean hued clam pieces. i have kokomi and shes fully built.\n",
      "honestly love it. loved it from the start. i stopped playing because i was so addicted to exploring. im back into playing it again because i can control myself now i think haha. if the reason why you play is exploring and the story content youll never run out of stuff to do. if youre playing to whale and do end game content then youll run through the game fast. i didnt like leveling my characters in the past and playing boss content but now am enjoying farming things for my characters\n",
      "this is probably the best rpg of its kind your going to find on mobile graphically and game play wise in my opinion at least the best ive found. you can spend a buttload of money on the gambling mechanic rolling for better characters and weapons if you want but you dont need to. i havent spent anything and have a nice variety of characters and weapons updates are pretty regular with new content combat system is interesting and while ive never used it there is a coop feature as well\n",
      "the game is running smooth it doesnt lag the graphics is amazing and the cgi makes it realistic. the only problems is when i always encounter the dragon the game glitch and its hard to see whats on the screen. i think the dragon needs more work.\n",
      "too large takes up way too much space and constantly fails to update because of it. worst yet the updates need new space so you effectively need double the size of the program at all times so you can update. probably around 30 gb and no using the sd card gains you nothing. do yourself a favor and either skip this or just play it on a console or pc.\n",
      "its a fun game its very well made and extremely detailed and an engaging adventure game and the most fun ive had in a while. edit i have some things to say about the game that kind of ruins the enjoyment grind y nature fluctuating writing quality strange company to audience relationship..otherwise its still a fun game if you arent burnt out by the grinding.\n",
      "personally love all though i can tell where people are coming from the new puzzles are quite challenging. i honestly love ayato and the new events. so many unique and awesome characters i love the hangouts and such. i wish there were more events that new players could partake in my friend is new and cant do any of the events and feels he is missing out.\n",
      "it runs smoothly and overall great game but for some reason on my device some things are not displayed like ice on water damage numbers and the stormterror boss fight. i assume this is an common issue among low end devices. but please fix this as soon as possible.\n",
      "im addicted to this game the story is amazing and even the cut scenes are great i made friends as well the stickers and characters are also cute. no ads too the graphics character design weapons everything was so pretty and adventurous the characters even have their own stories which makes it fun.\n",
      "one of the best mobile games weve ever had i cant believe this game is free. awesome gameplay beautiful exploration and compelling storyline. the game still has a lot to improve on though like the horrible rng for artifacts and how limited the endgame content is. but overall i recommend everyone to play this game if youre looking for an open world experience.\n",
      "overwhelmed by the gameplay it gives a console like feeling with amazing graphics and no ads. the story line is very good and new content seems to be added here and there. it is completely free to play and fair even if youre a free to play player. and character customisation is huge \n",
      "amazing mobile open world game engaging story beautiful and well developed characters good sound design and energy resin based so you only need to play 20 minutes ish a day. my only gripe is the endgame content since there is no endgame. after building your characters and unlocking their upmost potential you have nothing to use this on. very good game overall its just that the endgame sucks\n",
      "mostly great game. graphics story gameplay events character design are all great. several problems that i dont think at this point will ever be resolved. i mostly play on pc and the game has a small stutter. im on a 3070 and forums basiclly say its a unity engine thing. also artifact grinding is 99 of end game. the game needs some sort of end game activity like honkai has. and pc client is still locked at 60 fps. still a great game maybe itll be closer to honkai in terms of qol soon.\n",
      "the graphics look great and the story animation is amazing. i love how we can complete the missions without any difficulty. in my opinion tho its nice if we can have the co op mode at level 5 or 10 bcause it takes time to reach 16. people might eager to play with their friends.\n",
      "its good but too demanding even for a upper mid range phone. and theres occasional glitches in some cutscenes where the audio of the game continues but the scene doesnt. i can barely play it even in the lowest settings and my phone is fairly powerful. edit was powerful.\n",
      "its not a bad game if you get past the bad game mechanics. like how some characters are adventure rank locked and the energy system to do things is really bad. and some people who play the game. but characters are not to hard to get if you plan out you resources and get them.\n",
      "great game the only big flaw with it as far as i can see is the gotcha system. it costs too much to get the characters and weapons and with the rate they come out at its basically impossible for free to play people to get anything good.\n",
      "they have really good stories that trigger your mind to find solutions sometimes can get a little laggy when you join anothers player world but it gets back to normal after few minutes. i recommend not to level up in world level until you are fully equipped.\n",
      "this game is very fun indeed. but as a starter i hate the amount of cutscenes that are implemented into this game. i couldnt enjoy much. anyways despite being on a new and more better device this game is quite laggy and crashes sometimes. i have edited this part i just wanted to say my world does not have any grass or any effects like when u hit a monster they dont put the amount of damage or superconduct or immune or anything. fix this\n",
      "this is by far the best game ever its very interesting full of adventures quests and there are even new characters and versions so quickly. this means more quests added and with that its much funner you get to fight weekly bosses commissions bounties enter domains abyss and earn ez money the only problem about this game is its storage whenever updates come the storage it occupies reaches up to 15 gb sometimes. although besides that the game is very addictive and interesting \n",
      "dear developer game. for the rating of this game itself its not too bad but needs improvement when updating. pre download files from games should not pile up with old files or i should suggest there is some kind of setting what data files we can delete in games such as sound files. so that later it does not grow and interfere with users. that is all from me \n",
      "i enjoy this game a lot and i love the characters. but recently i have been dealing with a few glitches where my game would freeze or when i close the app there would be a strange sound coming from my phone. i believe that a glitch is behind it and please fix it \n",
      "i love this game there are super interesting characters for all playstiles and theyre always releasing more. the only problems ive had are with the endgame content theres not much to do after lvl 50 weapon banner is a terrible thing and also the resin system is kinda of a problem here\n",
      "great game amazing story graphics etc. i feel like storage wise they could fix something especially for mobile users. also yall crying about the skin tones are pathetic as heck. play a different game then if any of the upcoming characters become poc its an instant skip.\n",
      "i have been playing for a good 2 years and i loved it at 1st however i cant even get into the game. i understand that this game isnt small but i recently got a new pc and cromebook i wanted to play this game on both and when i tried on both devices it said that there wasnt enough storage. it started to load on both but then after it reached 100 it said that my storage was full. i didnt download anything or add anything to either of my devices before i opened the game. i still would like to play\n",
      "it was a great game and after 2.7 update i felt that the doesnt lag that much anymore but it only lasted for a few days then it became laggy to play again. its still playable though. however when i logged in my account to my laptop and played genshin there the account installed in my phone doesnt even load. i dont understand why logging my account in my laptop makes the app installed in my phone even more laggy. please reply or help me resolve this thank you.\n",
      "ive been playing genshin impact for over a year now. early game it is very charming and fun. a lot of content quests events and hangouts to do. but when you get to ar 50 ish things tend to get boring. things you could do end game are just new events dailies farming domains and or coop. overall i would rate this game is a 9 10.\n",
      "the game is great but it gets very boring once you reach a higher ar. its very repetitive and there is no endgame coming in the near future. spiral abyss is the only endgame content but some players are not interested in that. if the new regions are just going to be more exploring and quests then i wont be suprised if genshin will be labeled as a dead game.\n",
      "i cannot play the game two stars because i heard the game is awesome and ive seen gameplays. it astonishes me that this game is free with all the graphics and the story. but i would love to see that by myself and i cant since everytime its done downloading the game and its about to start it crashes and i cant even play it in the end... talk about gameplay. please do something about this.\n",
      "the game is great the graphics are amazing the characters are creative.events are also interesting.wishing for characters can be exciting but sometimes dissappointing tho overall everything is good it may lag on the phone.\n",
      "i have been playing for 6 months as of this review. pros 1 decent story 2 great music 3 interesting characters and personalities cons 1 badly designed power creep. challenging content is great but the playerbase hates enemies that are way too op or cheap e.g. rifthounds specters and serves more like a dps check chore than providing a fun challenge. 2 lack of manual aim. 3 lack of a true enjoyable end game. abyss is the endgame we have but there is exponential power creep compared\n",
      "easily the game of the year amazing storyline fun gameplay and incredibly beautiful artwork at a free to play price. youll hear a lot of criticism targeting gacha games but the truth is youre the player and its you who decide if you enjoy a casual or competitive pace. edit played from launch and its still at the top of my list beating all other mobile games ive tried since\n",
      "the game is excellent just a small thing i wish devs should do is make a setting where the game does not render all the graphics and just a color or part of the object something called as potato graphics. this can help reduce cpu usage and would surely help a lot of travellers.\n",
      "this is so good the graphics are great it makes me calm and i love decorating the tea pot but one problem is that its taking so much storage i think you should add a thing that erases the past events so the storage would lessen a little bit but still a five star this is the most awesome game i have ever played \n",
      "i like this game because it is only the game which is the level of anime and not only this they fix their all bugs very faster than other games. the stories of this game is very very unimaginable. i like yelans story quest than other .i request to hole genshin impact team to make quest like the yelans . some quest are also very nicer than yelans but there is no voice so because of this the game sometimes gives the odd experience .there is also issue in hud costumisatin for mobile platform. \n",
      "its a really cool game the graphics the game play are also pretty cool especially how its open world gives u the chance of exploring and all but ive yet to understand why there are only three characters that are dark skinned and the rest are as pale as paper and also the new dedro character literally looks like dendro paimon i feel like there should be more variety of skin colours in the game rather than just pale and definitely a change on the new archon\n",
      "i havent played the game but based of the fandom i really like it. i need help with something though. when ever it says start i press start and then a loading screen pops up saying wear head phones for a better expirience. i redownloaded it multiple times and i even switched servers. maybe its because the first time i downloaded it i deleted it cause i thought it took too long to load. hoyoverse please help me.\n",
      "at first the game is pretty amazing but eventually nearing the endgame its all about dmg and artifacts its no longer fun unlike the beginning. it just feels like being forced into the game to do commissions and spend your resin its no longer fun not being able to look into things like before.\n",
      "do i even need to say why this game is the best story 10 10 music 10 2 10 exploring 10 10 graphics 10 10 story development 11 10 game mechanism 10 10 my phone has a snapdragon 665.i know my phone cant handle something heavy game like this. but i really wanted to try this so i gave it a try.playing at the lowest setting as possible.im just addicted. the music and graphics are too good that sometimes you just stood there and wander to hear the theme song and the beautiful visuals.\n",
      "overall good game. spent the last 10hours or so experiencing it without any help or guides and i havent been prompted to spend a dollar. no energy depletion no paywall thus far and overall im thoroughly enjoying the game as it is. there will likely be a paywall towards the later stages but that is acceptable as is with all mmorpgs.\n",
      "ive been playing this for a year now my only problem when it comes to artifact farming is it really is disappointing. ive been farming for half a year now and a lot of artifacts doesnt make sense. it really waste my time. now theres another element leak it will also lessens our probability to get higher stats artifacts. i hope hoyoverse here us out. cause our main problem is not character wishing. all characters are the special on their own and we cant maximize it. we only have few resin\n",
      "cant get it to download fully. beautiful graphics. seems as if it could be a great game to play. 1 star for not being able to fully download the extremely large resources . after more than half of dl completed games keeps force closing. very frustrating. uninstalling. hopefully you can get this fixed.\n",
      "ok i know i rated 3 stars but i love this game so much and i play it all the time. theres a couple problems though. 1 why does it take so much space. like seriously every update takes atleast 1gb 2. aiming is hard. when you have an arrow character aiming is so hard. 3 wifi. if my internet connection isnt perfect the game is so laggy\n",
      "the game is amazing. love it. they could fix a few things like character banners resin the map and other things which they will have issued with in the future but it is still a awese game and i would 100 recommend it.\n",
      "genshin impact is amazing the graphics are nice and the overall idea of the game is interesting. although i love the game i have to say that its storyline is falling off this game had been one of my favorites until inuzuma was unlocked inuzuma felt rushed and the events have gotten very boring the 4 stars of genshin after inuzuma was released also fell off the designs of inuzuma and its characters are great but theyre boring. overall though i really enjoyed this game.\n",
      "uhh its kinda boring now. it is a stunning game but there is little to no endgame content and the pity system is extremely unfair and annoying. the game creators have barely any representation of black cultures with characters and designs. other than a few other problems the game is a solid rpg mmo game with fun gameplay lots of characters and cool characters animations. the lore of the game is very deep and is all explained or yet to be. this is not a grindy game so play once every few days \n",
      "the game is amazing music visuals and very addicting but the latest updates and the new character kits rushed archon quests and horrible anniversary ignorance were really displeasing i hope the team learned from their mistakes and we dont have anything like that anymore in the future\n",
      "i do enjoy playing genshin impact but i am having issues with the new update. when i check the events it says that i still need to go to the chasm and unlock a quest to defeat the new boss. i have completed the required quest and defeated the boss but but when i check events it still hasnt updated itself even after uninstalling the game and reinstalling it. please help hoyoverse\n",
      "i love it its very addictive i like how you get to chose between the male or the female twin and the gameplay is awesome too the attacks are cool i prefer lumine over aether because shes underrated. when you unlock statues you can pick between the elements. the game is difficult in ways due to levels of the mobs and yourself thats all bye thank you for reading 3\n"
