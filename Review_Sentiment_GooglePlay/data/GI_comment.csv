"The game in general is the best I've ever played in terms of adventure, fighting, scenery, events, etc. The only thing I'd like to be changed is the space it takes to run. If we are unable to replay story quests and scenes, it should be reasonable to have an option to delete those extra unused files to have more space. Other than that, best game out there.",32,"August 23, 2022",5
"I absolutely love and adore this game. By far my favorite story roleplaying game out there. The quests, lore, plots, mysteries, grind, pulls, all of it. I'm a newer player, but I haven't been bored yet of this game. I don't think I ever will. I'd say it's biggest issues is lagging, and setting it's quality different on its own. As well as occasional bugs on my laptop. If the frame per second(fps) could be a bit quicker that would be great. But other than that, the game is beautiful. Will update.",643,"August 16, 2022",5
"It is amazing, I have only been playing it for a few day, it been lagging a lot, might be becuse of my storage 😅, but all I need to say is, it's amazing! The art style is amazing too, 9/10, when you change to another app for even a second or keep it open in the background, it just puts you back on the menu screen, for a person who dose like, 5 other things on their phone at the same time, it's a problem, nothing truly bad to say. 9/10, Love it",396,"August 21, 2022",4
"This game is truly amazing and getting better day by day, though it has many bugs and features that could be fixed for a better game experience. 1- My major issue is the storage this game is taking. Im not sure if there's a fix for it, but it's getting out of hand and many (mobile) players are being forced to fully quit. 2- On mobile, most times the chat will not open or glitch in coop, which is annoying but it usually comes back after a few seconds. Though, its overall a great game, I love it.",188,"August 19, 2022",4
"The release of Sumeru gave so much to do! I've been playing for over a year. It's got amazing graphics and tons of different characters to choose from. The story has got us anticipating more. Although it is captivating, it isn't really new player friendly. The new characters and weapons require items that new players can't have access to. It can cause them to rush through the story. Other than that however, the game has been treating us nicely. I hope the second year anniversary won't fail us.",91,"September 5, 2022",4
"I really like playing Genshin Impact, its really fun and I like exploring and building my characters. The only issues I have with the game is the lack of diversity, and the lagging, and how much time it takes for an update to get done. I try and play on my mobile phone, but for the past few updates, I've had to get rid of apps and clear my space on my phone because of how much space this one app takes. Other then those issues, all is good, keep up the good work Hoyoverse.",6,"August 24, 2022",4
"Great game, the open world aspect is very well handled. Leveling up in adventure rank is a chore but isn't that bad. Best thing is that paying money to wish isn't required, you can get new characters and progress through the game without spending anything and it isn't even pushed on you to spend money, it's just an option.",8,"August 23, 2022",5
"The game is fun, and surprisingly f2p friendly and good quality despite it's reputation as a gacha game. But 2 issues, 1 issue is that you can get a character affiliated with a state in a lvl 30 zone, but can only progress to lvl 20 before needing items from the 30 zone to upgrade further. So if you get a character that isn't affiliated with lvl 1-29, you get screwed over. 2nd is that despite being a single player game, requires a stable internet connection. AFAIK there's no way to go offline.",14,"September 9, 2022",3
"Definitely a great game that's made great strides compared to the first time I installed it. It's still very laggy especially as the game includes more, but it's improved. It's not very free to play friendly though. For the amount of characters coming out, the spacing of events and primos possible make it very difficult to achieve getting characters. I experienced this in a major way as a beginner because of the large gap in what I wanted versus what was possible.","1,203","August 24, 2022",4
"The best mobile game I have ever played, and I've played around 400+ over the years. In terms of replayability, daily drops, animation, combat, characters, Genshin is totally unmatched by anything else. I also wanted to say that the weight of the characters feels good. Jumps, attacks, flying, it l feels natural. Really good stuff, I will continue to drop many hours and dollars for the privilege of playing.",505,"August 24, 2022",5
"Honestly, Genshin is everything I'm looking for in a game. A fantasy setting, open world exploration and representation of real cultures, characters, beautiful art and graphics, cool outfits and weapons, co-op, quests, events, and music! The developers have worked and are continuing to work really hard on satisfying players with constant updates. In my opinion, you don't need to pay to make the experience fun. It's amazing no matter what. :)",116,"August 15, 2022",5
"LACK OF DIVERSITY!! I have been playing this game for almost 2 years, daily. It has a good overall experience + things to offer. However, an issue that's been here from the start and has become more obvious with new releases is that it lacks diversity. Skin tones, body shapes, weapon styles and more are very, very lacking. We as a community have been saying this for almost 2 years, yet get no response and are ignored or flagged. Aside from these issues being problematic, it's just bad designing.",630,"August 23, 2022",2
"Would be a 5-star review if Android had the option to use a controller. Game is very expansive and you get a lot for free. Wishes can be spendy cash-wise but you get plenty of opportunities for free gear if you play consistently. Graphics are great and run smooth. Story is unique (to me at least). Gameplay is simple and effective. Again, if we could use controllers, easy 5-star. Accessibility is lacking because of this.",30,"August 10, 2022",4
"The game is overall good. Love the story so far & where it's going. My only complaints are the gacha system & the visuals, really. The game isn't F2P friendly at all; the rates are kind of low, & it drains the wallet. While the view in the game is extraordinary, the vastness of the game can deteriorate the quality of gaming. EDIT: There's also definitely a lack in variety now when it comes to the characters. Besides the new update, there's little opportunity of new, interesting team builds.",12,"August 24, 2022",3
"Yes, this game is good, with an interesting plot and lore. But the graphics are a little too extreme. Yes, I know, this game is getting beautiful sceneries with a high set of graphics, but I cant help but get a lag spike even when it says that the graphics are good to the point its smooth. That, and the fact that sometimes after fighting enemies, I find myself not being able to chat. Either way, a cool game, with beautiful sceneries and amazing characters that have an interesting lore.","1,674","July 24, 2022",3
"Updated Review: The game has pretty good quality (music, art, VA, etc.) updates that have been consistent for an entire year. The game is fairly easy to navigate and there's a decent amount of content for new players at this point of the game. However the bad part is it's getting a bit taxing on your system the more updates they release, so you might need a high end computer to run it.",80,"August 11, 2022",4
"I've played more than my fair share of gacha games. Genshin Impact has improved on all of them with an open world that's interesting to explore. Additionally, they've managed to avoid both the unnecessary powercreep usually seen in the genre, as well as keeping the systems simple to understand and play, while still rewarding mastery with fun gameplay. Overall, it's well worth getting into.",28,"August 15, 2022",5
"Gameplay is great, world is beautiful, even with limited graphics, and characters and their designs are amazing. However there are numerous problems. Lack of content besides from limited events, artifact grinding taking a copious amount of time, etc. However, the biggest problem for me right now is how often the servers disconnect. My WiFi is fine, I've changed it before, and my phone ran it fine before. This issue makes the game almost unplayable and it happens way too often(every 5-15 minutes)",189,"August 7, 2022",3
Amazing. I would like it if any time I minimized the game it didn't have to re-connect and that you could unlock constellations instead of wishing. The main plot progresses slowwww and a lot of the quests are VERY monotonous and childish. Other than that it's a good game . I've spent a few real dollars playing and don't regret it.,261,"July 12, 2022",5
Update: 2.8 to 3.0 Genshin couldn't be better of a Game! Though i do wish there were more viable DPS characters instead of the support types we've been getting as of late. I love the game. No problems. Great storyline. Amazing art. I'd love to learn from the artists. VERY HAPPY WITH GENSHIN.! OLD: Keeps crashing after 2.5 update won't even get to the loading screen. Have plenty of available ram and storage space. I've even tried uninstalling and reinstalling twice,44,"August 11, 2022",5
"Look the game is fun for the most part, but this is twice now it has dumped my account after not letting me email verify. I was almost at level 26 this last time and it was really frustrating to log on and it start from the beginning. I am trying to verify to sync it so it doesn't happen a 3rd time and nothing happens when I hit send code. *edit* I am loving this game. The story is so involved, and the puzzles can be quite tricky at times. I even have a few that are pinned for later.",77,"August 25, 2022",4
"Almost 2 years of scattered play. I always return for new content. The stories are fun and the game play is too. Some of my friends started playing recently and they like it but it's a lot to get through as far as reputation. I think Mihoyo may need to come up with a faster route to get new players caught up with older players - so old and new players can play ""fairly"" what I mean is, I don't want to lower my world level and lose rewards, or wait for my friends to get stronger for a few months.",23,"August 24, 2022",5
"i love this game a lot. great story, great gameplay, all the characters have their own story and its super engaging. however, the storage it takes is a little ridiculous. im being forced to quit because my phone cant handle it. its a really good game! i hate to quit, it just takes too much storage. hopefully a version for nintendo comes out.",2,"August 24, 2022",4
"Most games that have multiple platforms do not perform well when switching to a mobile device. I'm beyond impressed with this mobile version. While I still enjoy the control/accuracy I get playing on my PC more, if I'm away from home this is an awesome alternative. Especially given the fact that it's free with no ads.",116,"August 23, 2022",5
Genshin Impact keeps you entertained and unable to set your phone down. It's interactive and provides multiple quests to go on. The graphics are aesthetically pleasing as well. Only issue is the quick battery drain with long periods of playing. It's to be expected though. Definitely recommend this app when you want to kill some time.,56,"August 9, 2022",4
"I love this game. Even though sometimes, I go on a break from it, I still will always love it. The characters are interesting + strong, you have artifacts, very good plot development, and many many more reasons why I love this game. Even if there's a few to many bugs, I'd still play it to let the devs know about these bugs. The areas are also fun to explore, as well. Some people managed to get extremely strong characters that are underrated!",127,"July 12, 2022",5
"This game is mad fun. Great characters, gameplay, world, design, it's great. The MUSIC is absolutely bonkers good. I docked a star because there are some blaring issues that haven't gone away. Hoyoverse listens to the player-base sometimes, but some problems will probably never be fixed. These don't bother me, I have lots of fun with this game as long as I don't make it a chore.",50,"August 17, 2022",4
"RNG is really bad in this game. Fun, but still no controller support for Android (despite all other platforms having it) and it seems they intend on keeping it that way. The game itself runs worse with each update. I've had to turn graphics settings down just to keep the game playable every single time now due to updates. I think this game is comparable to games like craftopia. You could make your own fun in the beginning but it quickly gets boring.",118,"September 9, 2022",1
"Overall, this game is amazing! I originally played on my computer but it always lagged. I later downloaded it on my phone and I've had a few problems; My amount of damage won't show, everytime I go near water, it glows at a certain angle & distance, and more. After asking other players on different platforms, I found out that this isn't just a me problem, but a problem for most of the android genshin players. I'd love to get any information to help with this problem, or someone to fix it",96,"July 13, 2022",3
"Hey, great game, first off! But I'm experiencing a bug recently the camera, not one of the ""Kameras."" Zoom seems to be inverted. Zooming ""in"" ( + ) is zooming out, and zooming ""out"" ( - ) is in. I looked in game settings but didn't see any settings that would invert the in-game screengrab function... so help its mildly annoying but when you're wanting a nice shot especially in the event and it zooms ""out"" when you're wanting in its irritating. Thank you for a great and enjoyable game!",151,"July 24, 2022",5
"Nevertheless genshin is one of my favorite games of all time and it's a really good game in general. 9/10 would recommend. Edit Also it's alot of fun to play with friends and can lead to some really funny moment lol Edit, 8/24/22 the game is still super good, and I love playing it but now I only really play it on my computer. It takes up to much storage, and to help with the lag my full storage create Ive turned down my graphics so it's not as good anymore.",2,"August 24, 2022",4
"The mobile version doesn't do this game justice, it's much less laggier on console and on a good pc. The graphics are amazing on those platforms, the music is great and the story is great. However once you complete the story there is next to nothing to do and it gets repetitive very fast. It's very difficult to earn primogems so in order to actually have a great experience with the game, you're basically forced to spend money on it.",116,"July 29, 2022",4
"Edit- until my android is able to use a controller with this game, its no longer viable. Difficulty ramps up and i cant keep up on touch controls. It was fun while it lasted. Been playing this on phone and pc since release. This game is not just good. This is art, this is a quality triple-A game, that can be played for zero dollars. For once, I feel GREAT supporting a game through an occasional microtransation. I pray this game goes for ages.",13,"August 16, 2022",3
"Superior cross play capabilities that are ahead of it's time. I can get off the PC and play on my phone with very little to impact the gameplay. Beautiful story and design and very little bugs! Game is 100% enjoyable FTP. Only thing I can think of to improve is to add gamepad support for the Android version, I use a dual screen phone with programmable gamepad options, but for those using products like the Gamesir X2 are out of luck. This lack of support is my one star penalty.",145,"August 4, 2022",4
"I took a hiatus from the game after the messy first anniversary. I'm more of a seasonal player now; my goal is to do the events and gather lore. Stellar art direction, gameplay mechanics, music, environment, story, and characters. Resin cap needs to be doubled (320), and cost should be halved (20), at the very least. As a result of the resin limitation, artifacts still being heavily RNG is extremely frustrating. Events should be archived so players can view it again, since they're full of lore.",38,"July 28, 2022",4
"I love this game and have been playing it for a while. But with this new update, my game barely runs. Barely any of the assets load in properly, textures don't show amongst other things. I want to continue playing, but I'm slowly beginning to struggle. I've spent hundreds on this game and made amazing memories on it and I'd hate to have to leave it.",10,"August 24, 2022",3
"I love genshin ever since I downloaded it back in the end of March of 2022! But with the recent 2.8 update it keeps crashing on me and lagging bad time, as in I'm just trying to do a single commission and it crashed on me twice in just an hour, I play on mobile(Samsung s10e) and my phone is completely up to date, and I've never had any problems before, so I'm just wondering if it's just my phone or if it's with everyone else. Other then that I love this game and it got me addicted quick lol",63,"July 14, 2022",4
"Good lore, good story, gameplay is challenging. I really wish we were able to personally choose a 5 star and 4 stars / side banner that we wanted as a permanent thing, it's extremely hard waiting for specific 5 star banner characters every other few weeks to even months, it's ridiculous and time consuming. Btw a few of the skills on lower 3 tier weapons should be changed as well, might be cus I'm still kinda new, but I find some really useless for almost all of my characters.",1,"August 23, 2022",4
"It's a good game but crazy expensive too get characters and level them. Biggest gripe is that the camera moves around during battles so that half the time the view is blocked by grass, rocks or buildings. I know it's to be cinematic and works well on flat ground but incredibly annoying on other terrain and screwed me over a few times on bosses. Please give option to turn it off.",19,"September 9, 2022",4
"it is a really fun game, just recently i have had some issues. First, i do play on chrombeook, because finically it is the best i can do, but it crashes after preparing to load data. Second, there isnt any controller support, and it is stuck using the mobile layout, which is a pain for non touchscreen devices. Third, and finially, there are some asset files that simply dont download, for example Dvalin is wings, crystals, and glowing eyes, no neck or body. Overall i love the game, but cant play.",36,"August 17, 2022",3
"Amazing Music & Graphics! 😍 I've been playing off/on since the start & while I don't have all the characters or their constellations I still have a lot of fun playing. The free events rewards & the web daily login rewards are helpful. The map from their Tools helps a lot. I love that you can solo it all or you can choose multi. I play this on the PC with a numbered gaming mouse so I'm glad I can change keybinds. If you can, try both Mobile & PC versions to see which is best for you.",56,"August 1, 2022",5
"Amazing!!! I never experience any bugs or glitches and it runs smoothly and I can enjoy the gameplay. The game is super fun and I love the storyline and the events that make the game even better to enjoy. But the wishing system makes it harder for free to play players that dont want to spend any money on primogems. Other than that you can still have fun with the characters that you get. I WILL SAY THAT INAZUMA HAS REALLY HARD PUZZLES THEY MAKE ME CRY. ok I'm done but yeah, GET THE GAME!",15,"August 23, 2022",5
"Amazing map, characters, banners, events, bosses, and overall, deserves 5 stars. I love the graphics, story, domains. It does take a REALLY long time to load when you first download, takes up space, but that doesn't matter compared to the story and lore. Great game. I love the banners, although I've heard the older characters, like Klee, don't get reruns often. I got early pity on both Xiao and standard banner. Great characters, I fell in love on like, the first day playing it. Thanks HoyoLab!",275,"August 5, 2022",5
"I LOVE IT! The characters, the scenery, the updates, ect. It's such a fun game and its pretty realistic in certain ways. Like the creator of genshin deserves a noble peice price. The only thing is how you have to buy outfits and other stuff, but it's the best game I have ever played and I'm looking for more updates and banners.",13,"August 6, 2022",5
This game is very vast and beautiful. The storyline is engrossing and entertaining. I enjoy every game feature but the advancing through the story while obtaining characters and advancing them is extremely uneven. You are forced to buy characters to be able to defeat difficult bosses because you need drops from those bosses in order to advance certain characters. Its very disheartening. And the difficulty is getting harder and harder. Its sad because the game is soo beautiful.,7,"August 27, 2022",3
"Genshin Impact prides itself on story and exploration, the only problem I have is the lack of a skip button for story and cutscenes. There were times where a story boss took me a while to beat. In these occasions, I had to go through the same unskippable cut scenes, dialogue, and tedious boss phases just to get another shot at the part I mainly have trouble on. Besides that, The game is great and is, to an extent, very F2P freindly. So far, at AR 35, it has yet to feel P2W. But is tough at times",4,"August 11, 2022",4
Good game I had a lot of fun playing this but after finishing the main storyline the game gets quite boring unfortunately and while they do update the main quest after a while it takes a lot of space on my phone for me to almost never play it. However the character variety is great the weapons are great and can be quite a challenge. Really open world which is awesome and the experiences I had were great but after a little bit it's gets boring. Over all good game though,6,"August 28, 2022",4
"My internet works fine, I put my data on when I play, and I can not log in. I could play fine before 2.7 but not anymore. Sure, I lagged sometimes but not like this. When I get to the door on the loading screen it just kicks me out. I don't know what to do. I decided to delete it. Alr so I deleted it and redownloaded and it's all good now so yay! :))",6,"August 24, 2022",3
"Game is pretty fun and has a good base, but the lack of endgame content outside of artifact farming(gear equipment) and spiral abyss makes this game feel empty once you complete the daily commissions, use up resin, and have already challenged the abyss for the current rotation. I don't expect anything related to endgame be implemented in the near future. But, with how the game's story is slowly inching towards the end, something new and permanent would be nice.",452,"August 24, 2022",4
"This game is overall good, although, At some points in life, the game would stop working. After updates it would just shut down or you would not be able to enter the game. It would make you download it again and take up MASSIVE amounts of space when you already had it downloaded and an account. For me, this is a big problem that I feel like can be fixed! I think this game is perfect otherwise. <33",21,"July 28, 2022",4
"So I really like the game, for the most part. However during the battle with the electro cube thing it would just reset and I could not beat it. My friends have also had this trouble. The rest of the game is just fine. That bug just really upset me since I need the drops from it to upgrade my characters. I understand that this is a really big game, so I have no trouble waiting for fixes.",186,"July 22, 2022",2
"Simply put: I love the game. The world, characters, artstyle, combat, and music will suck you in. You don't need to spend any money to get cool characters, feel powerful and clear all the content. And there are a couple great options for light spenders so no need to whale. My only wish is for more permanent combat focused endgame. But try it out, I promise you'll have fun.",5,"August 19, 2022",5
"the game has a great lore and plot, but idk if its just my phone or if its the game. so everytime i play, its kinda slow but im somewhat fine with it. but then a few mins later when im trying to switch characters, it either wont change or a few seconds later it does but then reconnects the server, same with fighting, healing and all that and its getting rlly annoying otherwise its beautiful and has a good story to it",3,"July 31, 2022",4
"I've been playing this game s lot and I really like it. The graphics are amazing, it keeps my mind engaged with all the lore and missions. It's a game that takes a little bit of strategy to play, so you won't just be aimlessly running g around in it. Only thing bad I really have to say is that it doesn't have a pause button (in co-op mode, that is)",1,"August 5, 2022",4
"Good gameplay and really impressive world scale. Incredible that it's f2p. I don't mind the grind sometimes and when I find I get bored or am stuck, I just put it down and come back after a few weeks or more. The main problem I have is the lack of diversity in characters - physically, regarding skin tones, body shapes, hair types, etc - and diversity in game items - like weapon types/combat styles across characters. For a fantasy game, there is very little fantasy in the design of these things.",25,"August 25, 2022",3
"Let me first start off by saying that this game IS INCREDIBLE!! This game is NOT p2w(pay to win), it's f2p(free to play) 100%! The graphics, INCREDIBLE! The music, INCREDIBLE! The stories, INCREDIBLE! The cutscenes, INCREDIBLE! If you ever played Chrono Cross or Final Fantasy for the consoles, then this is the GAME FOR YOU! The file is big, 20GB but, it's worth it IMO! You'll need a powerful phone to play this, although you can change graphics to low, that takes away the exp. HAVE FUN!! 🙏❤️🙏",42,"July 13, 2022",5
"I loved the game, but sometimes it gets boring. Just doing quest and farming domains. It keeps crashing. Every 5 minutes or so please stop the crashing in the mobile , add something fun, and then the game is good please stop the crashing, it's annoying me so much. But without the crashing, it's a pretty good game",47,"July 21, 2022",4
This game is very amazing and entertaining the graphics are perfect and I would give it a five star but I have one problem when I play for some reason the game freezes and kicks me out randomly and it make the game really slow but I still think it is amazing for ipad or pc. It also take up too much data I had to get a second memory chip so I could download this and keep my other apps besides all of that this game is perfect.,3,"July 13, 2022",4
"Played since launch, max adventure rank. This is one of the greatest multi-platform game one can ask for. It may be a gacha game, but it certainly doesn't feel like one. The combat, playstyle, story, music, and visuals are absolutely top tier! You'd be missing out by not trying it and enjoying what a masterpiece of a game this is. What's even better you can play on any platform with cross saves across all, to play wherever and on whatever with same account as you wish. 10/10",18,"July 20, 2022",5
"The difficulty ratio when leveling up to a new world level seems heavily unbalanced. I've been playing this game since it debuted, but it keeps getting harder and I have been stuck for months. It's frustrating when this game has beautiful graphics and a wonderful storyline. Hard to keep pressing on when my player level is so low and it takes forever to grind away leveling up and not seeing much of a return.",130,"August 24, 2022",3
"there is a lot i love about it, great characters, beautiful setting, interesting story. but it has some drawbacks mainly the repetitive nature of a lot of the smaller quests, especially the daily ones, go do this small thing that is exactly the same as the last time, which very well might have been yesterday. but the biggest change id like to see is making the 10 pull more meaningful, tons of gacha gamrs like this make it a 10+1 pull just doesn't feel worthwhile to save for the big one.",3,"August 22, 2022",4
"Probably the best free gaming experience I've ever played, at least on Android, and the ability to play across other platforms is great too! But honestly I have had the easiest time pulling for good characters and equipment in this game than any other game, and I actually like the characters! Fully voiced and with their own unique abilities!",11,"July 14, 2022",5
"Good game. The early game is really immersive and the story hooked me. The open world is beautiful and great to explore. However, as you venture more into the game and level up, playing becomes more of a chore than an enjoyable experience. This is due to the lack of content that players will experience when they hit higher levels (AR 50+). Adding more end game content and implementing relevant player feedback would improve this game immensely. Hopefully this will be done in the near future.",8,"August 16, 2022",4
"Updated 8/24/22 I absolutely adore this game, I've been playing for almost 2 years now, very consistently. There was only one occasion where I got busy and took a longer break from the game. I like the combat system, characters and lore especially, but for a long while, and especially as of recently, there's been an extreme lack of diversity. Hoyoverse is making their regions based off real places, with real people who do not look like how the game has chosen to represent them.",34,"August 24, 2022",2
"Seriously, the most addicting game out there! Theres a reason that SO MANY people play this game. Its cool because you can either play on your own, exploring the entire MASSIVE world, doing quests while collecting and upgrading on your own. Or you can invite up to 4 other people from around the world to play with you. So much stuff to do and its all 100% totally F2P!! Ive been playing for over a year and ive never needed to pay a single dollar. Try it for yourself and youll be thanking me later!",0,"September 10, 2022",5
"Been playing since launch on both PC and mobile but mobile seems to be an awful experience 80 percent of the time. This game really needs a toggle for ""single player"" so it plays better. Recently been playing tower of fantasy on mobile and it runs better with multi-player real time users compared to genshins domains stuck at constant 999ms which don't ""require"" multi-player. Please consider a single player mode or an option to opt out of multi-player for mobile users thanks!",1,"September 9, 2022",2
One of the best free to play games period. It's not play to win. But if you want to get some of the really cool characters you might need to spend a bit of money. You can still get a chance to get the 5 star characters without it just takes a great deal of time and grinding and even then it's not always guaranteed. But overall absolutely amazing. They are always updating with new materials. Quests lines and boss battles. Epic is an understatement!,27,"July 16, 2022",5
It is a really good game. the graphics and the music are just beautiful. I do think it takes up quite a bit of space but it is worth it. I think this game really makes an impact(hehe get what I did there) on myself. Most of the time(when I'm not fighting monsters) it's very calming and fun. I definitely would recommend! :) <3,7,"July 18, 2022",4
"Literally just. Brainrotting over this game,,, so much lore,,, characters,,, yessss. Fair warning for beginners though, the game takes a while to download and the controls are a bit odd at first, but just fiddle around in the beginning and you'll figure it out. It's worth it in the end!!",10,"August 29, 2022",5
"i adore the game ! i love the graphics and the characters. the only problem i ever run into is that my game crashes consistently, and the only way to fix it is by restarting my phone. i don't really complain, as i figured it was just a problem with my phone as it has not happened to the other mobile players i've known.",5,"August 10, 2022",5
"This game is absolutely AMAZING, you should totally get it. The only problem for me is that I can't get the quest Undetected Infiltration. I've done everything. I've logged out, I even uninstalled the app and installed it again and that still didn't work. I had someone else do it for me which that didn't work either. Another thing is I can't see the health on hillichurls and stuff. Another than that this game is rlly fun! (I would rlly love to get this problem fixed tho ty)",2,"August 9, 2022",5
"I could say it's a fun game to play but I can never really get the whole experience of playing the game, anytime I open the game and it fully loads in like 5 seconds later it freeze and I don't know how to stop it from doing that, people on Google say lower the some the graphics settings but I can never do that because it always freezes before I get the chance too. But overall a pretty good game.",201,"August 3, 2022",2
"I'm going to be 100% honest. Genshin Impact is the most addicting game ever, better than minecraft actually. I love the game design and I think the idea kf u locking new regions with different elements in them is truly fascinating. The graphic designs are beautiful and I love how every dcharacter has a unique design that originates from their homeland. The plot of the entire game is also amazing and has a great lead on the stories. Overall, best game ever!",7,"July 12, 2022",5
"Sure, the game has amazing graphics and is easily the best free game, though I do not like how I have to delete all my apps just to play and for it not to load me in. The amount of storage it takes up is unbelievable and unnecessary. I would play if it would allow me to, it's been sitting in my apps for around an hour while I try to see if you guys have a discord sever. Please fix this problem.",25,"August 10, 2022",3
"I play on ps4 and mobile, and it's great. All of it is perfect except the fact that it randomly kicks me out while playing. I have absolutely no problems on my ps4, but it normally takes about 5 minutes after I enter the game for it to kick me out. This has happened for a VERY long time and, honestly, I'm surprised you haven't fixed this yet. Im not sure if it's my phone that is not working well with the app, or what, but I have a Galaxy S20 FE 5G. Please fix this, thanks!",6,"July 17, 2022",3
"It's definitely a cute and fun game, definitely worth a try if one is bored. My only real grievance with it is that it's hard to get any characters. Primocrystals take forever to accumulate it be much better that if you get 15 or 20 as rewards instead of 5. I quit once before because I could never get any decent characters or I got more weapons then I ever needed. Other then that pretty fun.",8,"July 20, 2022",4
"The first couple weeks playing the game feel phenomenal since the story is amazing and the progression is great. After a while though, it gets repetitive and content appears once in a while. Players have been having problems with lack of 2FA and lack of action against hacks. Feedback allows you to state concerns, but players tend to get back automated messages and nothing official. Changes may occur randomly and the F2P friendlyness is okay I guess.",14,"July 13, 2022",3
"It's a fun game. I've played it on ipad, PC, and android. I'm giving 3 stars because out of all the platforms I've played this on, android probably the least fun. The no controller support is a deal breaker. Using a controller is the main way I enjoy playing this. I really like genshin impact. It just frustrating there's no controller support on android.",14,"July 21, 2022",3
"Loads of gameplay and NO paywall holding you back like many games. My only complaint is that for as long as this game has existed, and as long as I've been asking, there is still no inverted y-axis controls for PC and mobile. It exists for anything with a controller, but nothing else.",4,"August 3, 2022",4
"This game is absolutely amazing! Incredible graphics, an amazing storyline, and interesting characters. However, my phone can no longer hold the game. The amount of storage this takes is ridiculous, and I'm going to have to uninstall because I'd like to have other apps on my phone. If you really enjoy genshin impact, it's ultimately better to play on a different device. It runs very smoothly and storage is not a problem when I play on PC!","2,075","June 16, 2022",3
"The game is really fun. Very entertaining. But I have some concerns, I don't know if it's just me but when I first downloaded the game. The quality was perfection. But now it's very blurry and blunt, and the sound crashes a lot which makes me suddenly get out of the game. And the storage is a huge problem. after the 2.7 update my phone just couldn't take it so i had to uninstall. but it does run very nicely on my pc or ipad without any problems.","1,654","June 25, 2022",3
"This game is gorgeous and fun and so easy to lose track of time playing. I get really sucked into the world. It does take up a lot of space, but I feel it is absolutely worth it. I have it in my phone and on my ps4. Though playing on mobile can be really tricky at times. I recently learned I can connect a Bluetooth controller to my phone, but there is no setting on mobile for a controller option. 😕",801,"June 22, 2022",4
"Really awesome game, I play it almost everyday. The graphics, story, character designs, mechanics, the overall contents of the game are impeccable. The only problem is it tends to crash on my device whenever I enter multiplayer, especially during domains. Other than that, this is one of the best games I have ever played and you'll get addicted faster than James Charles's career flopped.",484,"July 11, 2022",5
"Great game, I wish it were easier to get primogems so players wouldn't have to decide between skipping three banners and paying high amounts of money for the characters they want, but that probably won't be changing. Also the resin cap, both condensed and regular, are painful. Resin recovers excruciatingly slowly, and then the condensed cap makes it difficult to do much without stopping all the time to make more. Excited for the future though, I guess. The music and landscapes are beautiful.",69,"July 1, 2022",4
"The game is good, has a story, world, and characters that keep me coming back, and I play regularly on PC. But it turns out you kind of need a relatively newish phone to play the mobile version. Granted, my phone isn't super old, but the mobile version shouldn't be so unstable that it's a gamble if I can even get past the title screen. It feels like while this is a good looking game for mobile, it's the fact that it's so graphically intensive that keeps it from being playable on mobile.",73,"July 8, 2022",3
"I never liked to play mobile games and cross platform didn't seem viable to me. But this game made me change my mind! It plays well on mobile and PC and has a really good, gradual introduction of gameplay features. Maybe even a bit to gradual (slow) but maybe that's trying to enjoy it to the max and trying to every sidequest before moving on. It's just great and really well made. Addictive as well but that's what a good game should be and it's hard to not be tempted to play when I should work...",27,"August 21, 2022",5
"The visuals, music ,and characters designs are amazing and blends so well together that playing the game and exploring new places just makes me feel entranced everytime. I would have given it a 5* review if not for the fact that farming for primogems to wish is a tiring process. Other than that I love the game and I dont think I plan on deleting it anytime soon.",15,"August 14, 2022",4
"I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS GAME!!!!!! Nice graphics and super aesthetic sceneries. Frequent updates with new characters, events, quests and areas to explore. The music is also SUPER nice and always fits (sometimes I even listen to it on Spotify when I'm studying). Like, all of this is really stunning for an free App without ANY ads. Only pity: Some important story quests are time limited events so if you miss out on them, some things might be a bit confusing, but I'll strongly recommend anyway~!",17,"August 20, 2022",5
"The game is amazing and super underrated. Would give this a 5/5 on pc, but on mobile it's rlly laggy and the controls are clunky. If you have a pc, I would rlly recommend as its free and the combat is rlly fun. However, with the new updates, I feel the world map is becoming much too big and the new areas feel very repetitive and as if I'll only visit them once, and then move onto the next area. It doesn't help that each new city has much harder puzzles and now, each takes at least 10 mins",34,"August 24, 2022",4
"Top of the line graphics and gameplay and if you study east Asian languages this game is perfect for you because it's fully translated AND VOICED in Chinese, Japanese and Korean. My main complaints are its high battery use, device temperature and battery drain. Also it's an always online game even when you're on single player so you can't play it without a connection. It's incredibly addictive, but not very time consuming unless you want to do more.",9,"September 9, 2022",5
"I'm in love with this game I've been playing for year or two and it's really addicting because of the gameplay,quests,graphics,music and etc. But so many updates and the game storage growing is a problem for me. I had to delete genshin on my pc because I was out of storage and had to download it on phone. I just wish it didn't take that much of storage.",12,"August 24, 2022",4
"I'm loving the game very much. Tho there are a few visual glitches like the enemy's health bar disappearing after certain events occur like, using Fischl's burst, getting hit by a Gravedigger's projectile, and riding the waverider. It doesn't really affect me that much but it really get's annoying sometimes. Hopefully you may be able to fix this once the 3.0 update come. Cheers!",198,"August 21, 2022",5
"I've been playing Genshin Impact for almost a year or maybe more lol. The game has awesome graphics and storyline, the characters have a great designs and backstories. I don't really have any issues or bugs to report, just wanted to say that the game is amazing. I'm very excited for the new version 3.0 to come out and for the new characters. Thank you for letting us experience such a great game and to think it's free makes it even better! ^-^",41,"August 17, 2022",5
"It was fun when you're starting playing it but as you progress, it will get hard at a certain point. If you have a lot of patience in building/upgrading a certain character you want, this game is good for you. Edit: Due to the new update, the game became laggy, keep crashing, and it's been hard to control the keys (to mobile users). I'm not satisfied in terms of the new setting update.",142,"September 6, 2022",2
"Have been enjoying playing the game on PS4 and was looking to play more on my phone while away, only to discover that the android version doesn't have controller support, but the iOS version does. Been having alot of fun with the game but as it stands I can't get the full experience from the mobile version at the moment due to something I assume would be very easy to add to the game as they have already done it fot iOS.",57,"September 5, 2022",2
"Beautiful game, beautiful music. I wouldn't recommend if you aren't prepared to grind. Don't expect to get Characters unless you grind and save (for at least 2 full updates) or spend money. Artifact system desperately needs to change. Many characters are in need of reworks and/or buffs, I'm hoping they'll eventually do something about this, but I doubt it will change. After a certain level, playing often feels like a chore and can lose almost all enjoyability.",697,"August 29, 2022",3
"Love it! The melodies and scenes are all very calming, the characters are unique and this game has a bunch of secrets and mysteries that make you wanna play it longer. The problems are that it takes up a lot of space, my mobile phone may not be able to take up the space so I'm deciding if i should keep it or not. It is hard to grind artifacts in my opinion, and it's very likely to lose 50/50. All downsides aside, this game has a lot of attractive characters. One of the reasons i love it. - a bi",43,"August 25, 2022",4
"I've been playing this game since 1.6 and the gameplay, graphics, world-building and the characters are all great. However, this recent update has been less pleasant since the game would often crash. At first I thought the problem is my device but after hearing from my friends that they also experienced the same thing, I hope the devs would fix this soon. It really discouraged me to go back at the loading screen again.","1,032","August 25, 2022",3
"Keeps you playing for hours and the events are versatile and fun. You can see that the developers put their everything into it, from music to characters to the design of the areas. Although the story pace is a bit lacking but to each their own. Edit: The sumeru update is a huuuge step up from previous patches. The area is amazing and I don't even feel like sprinting, but just walking around, looking at the scenery. The archon story is PERFECT. Haven't felt so immersed in a while.",66,"August 29, 2022",5
"No words can explain how amazing the game is, the graphics, the characters, the story, but there is a problem, collecting primogems is a bit hard. there is a quest called ""In the mountains"" It's too hard and it takes a lot of effort, stay close to the fire and fight 3 robots! in the end I get 40 primogems. Please can you make collecting it a bit easier? Thank you so much for your hard work💕",46,"August 31, 2022",5
"this game is absolutely incredible, the only issue I have isnt really the game's fault. since my phone is god awful every time I'm doing a serious challenge like an ascension challenge it always crashes just when I'm about to finish it. I'd love it if you were able to spawn back into the domain or elemental trial to pick up where you left off.",22,"September 3, 2022",4
"It is nice and beautiful game, and through the years of developing it, I can say that it improved a lot. Though there are some bugs and issues that is needed to be fixed as soon as possible especially the issue in downloading and updating. A lot of users experiencing it especially in PC when downloading or updating the game, there are a lot of error before you can even downloaded it 100%. I hope these issues will be fixed soon. Anyway, it is a definitely a successful game after all.",125,"August 24, 2022",5
"I don't think I have to explain why this game is so incredibly beautiful. The graphics, the storyline, the characters are all very unique and wonderful! Although I'm encountering a problem, the quest ""Chasm spelunkers"" seems to have disappeared from the menu, even though I remember doing the first half of it, but suddenly it made me ""Go to the designated location to investigate"" and I can't do it! I have to complete the ""Chasm spelunkers"" but again as I said it disappeared! Please help",128,"August 24, 2022",5
"One of my favourite games. I can easily say that I'll be sticking with it till the last update and beyond. The controls and features are quick to learn, making this a great game for new players. The character design and open world are some of my favourite things, it's difficult to run out of things to do in genshin. One thing I'd like to see more of in the future is characters with diverse body types and skin tones, it would be nice to see a diverse range of characters.",147,"August 24, 2022",5
"Well... it is by far one of the biggest open-world mobile games I've ever played. Endless combinations of fighting styles, play styles and very easy to jump in and jump back out. Numerous events, user-friendly and F2P at that. You can also join other players or have them join your world. It's never ending and so much lore underneath a beautiful enduring landscape. There's cooking, and reading and looting. Controls can be a little wonky sometimes. And be prepared to use a phone charger. Enjoy!",5,"September 11, 2022",5
"It's very relaxing despite my graphics being on the lowest. The music is incredible. The gameplay is very casual and easy. If you focus on the gacha system and focusing so much with your characters' damage, you totally missing out the fun. Be grateful with what you get (TwT). But even so, being on high AR with no more events, it's quite hard for us to have something to do in the game. And please reduce the size of the game in mobile, not all of us can afford a new one. Looking forward to it!",458,"July 14, 2022",5
"the game itself is absolutely amazing, the lore, music, character designs, weapon designs, I just love them all. although I do have a problem with one thing and that's the gameplay, I just wished you can modify the controls to your liking, another one is that the graphics are just...too much every time I try to move my character I experience some serious fps drops, there is also alot of lag when picking up loot drops. so maybe you can improve on that?",614,"August 4, 2022",3
"It's very fun to play. The storyline is very captivating and the character designs are very beautiful. The open world concept is the best in mobile gaming, there's so many areas to explore and the scenery fit the lore of the region. The game music is very addictive, especially during certain quests. Pretty F2P friendly as well. But as you got to higher level there's not much to do when waiting for a new patch, so it get pretty boring for awhile.",363,"July 13, 2022",5
Thanks for your great game. It's really enjoyable and fun to play. Just I've got a small problem and it looks like a bug actually . In through the mist quest there's a problem with relay stones that doesn't connect yo the right one and I've checked everything and I'm sure about the others. I don't know if It's just my issue or other players have faced it or not. Thanks and I hope you'll fix it.,82,"August 5, 2022",5
"The game is great! The character design, the voice-acting, the environment, the storyline, and most importantly: the music. I love playing the game on my phone even though it's not the best experience I could get from the game. Lately, I got a MacBook and found out I can't download it in it. Since it does work on PC I couldn't find a reason for it to not work on MacBook. Please add the option.",47,"July 18, 2022",5
"This game is really good! It's fun due to its graphics, characters, designs, puzzles and more!, It's fun doing the archon quests and exploring new things, getting characters and more! But I do wish that in 3.1 that they will add a button in the settings to make paimon follow you, (sorry if it's too much to ask, I just love this idea)",6,"September 7, 2022",5
"Definitely the best game I've ever played before!! But I think I made a mistake of killing the bandits before getting the ""The Millennial Mountains"" quest, and now even after the bandits respawn, I killed them again but no dialogues pop up and even when I go to the valley where the ""Cup of Commons"" is kept, there were none. I'm thinking of restarting my whole adventure from square one, it would be fun though, maybe I'll do that. But overall, this is, hands down, the best game I have ever played",104,"August 17, 2022",5
"Overall its an addictive game, from gacha to puzzles and many more. The thing mihoyo should also add up to genshin for a better experience and gameplay is configuration of controls. Yes, it is already present on pc but not on mobile. It will really help all the player if they are able to configure the buttons especially if they are the type of person that keeps their things organized and are convenient for them.",129,"August 24, 2022",4
"The game is very fun to play, although I'm always skipping the dialogue a lot cuz the fighting style is more interesting. The puzzle's are great. It's a great game but no end game. Just one suggestion, CAN WE JUST HAVE A CHOICE. Where you can choose what you prefer black screen or white screen in the main screen after you opened game, it hurts your eyes a lot. And thank you if you reading this.",737,"July 21, 2022",4
"The world is absolutely beautiful and have a fantastic and rich lore. All the Arcon quests and step quests that's out are absolutely amazing and I love them all.

"The sceneries, characters design and storyline are super amazing! I've been playing this game a few weeks before launch. This is the best RPG game i've played so far and it's very good but it lags too much for me, I haven't been playing for a long time because it was too laggy so I had to delete it.

"""A console/pc game that's able to run on phone.' Probably the best description I could think of. It's got the ""open-world"" correct(deym the map is huge).The combat is also pretty good as it's not ur typical hack and slash type rather a""create elemental reaction for huge damage"" combat. Dailys can be a bit annoying but the rewards make up for it. Really don't need any banner units to enjoy the game and if u want to just save for the pity. All in all, is a pretty good game.",131,"August 20, 2022",5
"The game experience is amazing, and even getting better with every update. but... something is bothering me... story quests and archon quests MUST be replayable after completing and claiming the rewards. that whould be a great ability,while you have a chance to play and enjoy the stories again. plz add this feature to the game, while that's not really a complicated thing. all of the sources are exist in the game data and you've just need add a list of completed stories with a replay option.",189,"August 5, 2022",4

In March this year I finally had the chance to play it myself. I might be exaggerating for some, but in this generation of open world games, this is one of the best and the best.

"I love genhsin impact:) It's an awesome game, only problem is that it continuously glitches and way too much. Like for examamples, I could be fighting a boss, and it'll glitch mid fight and I'd loose health. Or i could be watching one of the uninteractive scenes and I wouldn't be able to see it and the voices would also glitch. But overrall, I absolutely LOVE this game. It's probably the best vidiogame I've played in awhile.",11,"September 4, 2022",5
"After entering Sumeru (Version 3.0 update), it feels like the game is more amazing. So many new contents: Archon quests, chain of many world quests, new events, new area to explore (Sumeru). I think it will take a lot of my time to clear all of those. The new map (Sumeru area) is so complex. Not to mention the new Dendro element. New characters to develop, too.",21,"September 5, 2022",5
"Genshin is a beautiful game with one of the best quality graphics, music and story line. However the game may be difficult for new players since it's always updating and takes up lots of space on your device. If new players aren't willing to spend much time on getting artifacts and building characters then they may not play. And talking in chat may be a problem as it is limited to short paragraphs.Other than that, Genshin is one of the best games I've played and it will continue to be that way.",157,"July 12, 2022",5
One of the best games with amazing graphics and one that the advertisement and promotional videos are actually how it looks like in the game. The laggyness some players experience is due to either their own phone or WiFi. I had the same problem with disconnecting with my old phone but got a new one and the graphics are absolutely amazing.,24,"August 23, 2022",5
This is a very nice game with beautiful scenery and fights. The only problem is with the size of the game. Now it is taking 20 gb of my phone space. Well for that level of graphics it may need that much space but I would be happy if I can delete unwanted things like voice lines and other things from my space to reduce the burden on my phone. Otherwise my phone may die by next year.,285,"August 25, 2022",5
"This is a solid RPG game with amazing story, lore and characters. The world is pretty and detailed, many times I forgot all about my quest and side tracked into exploring it. There were many moments when I just stopped to enjoy the view. Talking about the Gacha part, it's not too bad to be honest, you can get through the story and clear most content with free characters. If you save enough you can easily get a couple of 5 stars by AR45. It may be a bit spec heavy on phone, I mostly play on pc.",319,"August 6, 2022",5
"Seen I started playing, I've experienced new things and learned a lot by the stories. Playing with friends also feels good. I've been attached to this game .

"Haha. This game... blew my mind! I was hesitant to play after seeing the size of it, but downloaded it anyway. Mind blowing! Literally the best game in adventure genre. I'm able to run it on max settings and its been almost 2 days playing it. Found it hard to get what's going in game like quests, but after sometime, got used to it. I haven't experienced any bugs or glitches or lags till now. Will update my comment if I found one. I've recommended one of my friends also. I'm sure he'll love it.",239,"July 27, 2022",5
"This is undoubtedly my favorite open world game but I have a few complaints. I'm really hoping that they'll introduce the use of my Chromebook's keyboard since using the mobile layout doesn't always give the best gameplay. I also wish that they could add dmg numbers since it gets annoying when I can't see how much I do when I test my characters. It's also a bummer that I cannot see ice when water gets frozen in the game. Moreoever, the storyline, the characters and the events are great :)",765,"July 21, 2022",4
"This is the only game which has been in my phone for more than 2 years. Love the story, graphics and character designs they have created. The 45fps option is really good for me since 60fps was draining the battery pretty fast. Although, the occasional lag is still there.

The only frustration I have is that some events requires a lot of your time and attention and as a worker, its really a problem sometimes. But not all event are like that so I know miHoyo is considering all players. Graphics, lore and gameplay are definitely to die for. A game with constant updates and new contents? Genshin Impact has it all for you!",19,"August 24, 2022",5
"Truly one of the best games I've been fortunate enough to experience. The characters, the lore, the gameplay, the exploring (even tho it's tedious for me), I adore this game and it has helped me meet great people. The only issue for me is the game gets bland when you reach a higher level and there's not much to do towards the end of the update, except to wait for the new update. I hope they introduce some permanent things to keep us high ar level entertained.","1,540","July 12, 2022",5
"this is such a good game! even if it needs a lot of storage to download i still love it, and the character designs the battle scenes and the story line everything is amazing! and there's so much little details that i love, and I'm not gonna lie but i do want more dark skinned characters or maybe more representation but i do understand that everything is already planned out so I'm not going to complain, but overall it's an amazing game!",13,"August 24, 2022",5
"The story is exquisite. It is incredible, and the action is just right. The music is not only tailored to fit the regions, but I'm amazed by how beautiful they all sound. All details including the finer details when you look closer at them can really be worth exploring. Truly an experience worth the storage and worth spending money on despite it being a free game. Well done in creating such and excellent story game.",18,"August 26, 2022",5
"THIS GAME IS AMAZING, this game is so much fun I play it whenever I can!!! Edit: Still love this game but there are a few problems, it takes too much storage to be used on most devices. On chomebook (the only device I can currently use for this game) you cannot use the keyboard, only the touch screen. And as of now it crashes every time I attempt to start it. :(",55,"August 16, 2022",4
"I really love this game it my favourite already,but .. There is a little issue that I would like you to fix please, recently I've got to inazuma and well.. You can say that things haven't been going well honestly . It takes too long to download the area I keep falling every time I try to walk or climb adding that I can't even walk a single step without the game stopping, and in the videos in the main quests it always turns into a black screen it's really hard to play without being able to move",6,"August 31, 2022",5
"It's amazing and all but my phone can't take that much storage and there are already many things that I have a problem with, especially visual bugs. Like the grass, ice (on bodies of water), and especially the damage taken not being seen. Overall, it's a great game, I love it sm but please do fix these visual bugs as it greatly affects the gameplay. Much love to HoYoVerse<3",45,"August 24, 2022",4
"I've been playing this game for maybe 1y and I enjoy it, though it's extremely not perfect, this is the kind of game where you have to grind it (which can get exhausting) and the RNG of everything can be very unfair, but, the lore is amazing and the world is big and beautiful to explore, yes, it's not just the anime waifus, this game is actually good. I do have some issues with the phone version, I'm playing on Pixel 5 and I have a lot of connectivity issues and it constantly reconnects. 7.8/10",18,"August 11, 2022",4
"Game is good and I love the stories, quests and characters, all of them but except for one thing for low-end PC's or phones. The long loading just ruins it for me and you might know why. It's so triggering, right when the wrong moment comes; picking up something either they run away or when the loot from the chest rolls down and fall, plus when you try to open the map, adv book, characters, etc. It loads soooo long while you watch your character die from the monsters or fatui.",41,"August 26, 2022",3
"An amazing app! Good graphics, (a bit laggy, but that is kinda my device's fault), and no major problems so far. Well there was two problems that made me not play genshin for a solid 4 months, but both were my stupidity. (Not turning around and looking at a fricking wall thinking the 2nd floor is broken, ect.). No ads (I think) and a good storyline.",15,"August 15, 2022",5
"Great game, great graphics, fun reacton system, cool character design, bad resin timer, greedy company, zero communication, zero transparency. If you want a game to play for 5+ years, this is it! just make sure you don't do all the story in one go because you'll get burned out. Let yourself be lost while traveling the world. As for me, as a player since release, story and events eventually end and i only log in to do commission and use up all resin and im out. Which is just sad...",58,"August 23, 2022",3
"Very nice set up the characters and the scenery are awesome... If the device have much space and a good network.. the game is super fun to play with no lags and glitch what so ever... It really fun to play. Just the issue is the storage. When Inazuma map came it took half of the total storage and now with sumeru coming along, i think i might have to drop this game since my phone can't handle this much space. Pls give the users the right to delete some old files to reduce storage consumption.",17,"August 16, 2022",4
"I had installed genshin on my phone, it was fine. Now I've been trying for last 3 days to install it on my Samsung tablet but no matter how much space it has, it does not work. Stop giving us that pop-up screen that says ""hint"" not enough storage. Just tell us how many gb we need instead of that 'quirky' pop-up screen that annoys the hell out of everybody I don't know what the bug is that makes it so it doesn't like Samsung, but you need to fix it cuz I like gension but it's frustrating",7,"September 6, 2022",3
"It's been a while of playing, and I only hope the artifact system gets better anyhow. The story and everything else related to characters are always of great quality, the things behind that though, need a lot of polishing, like the Abyss, to make it easier for newer and less punishing to new players.",37,"August 24, 2022",3
"I want to say that I started to play this game around 9 months ago and on my old phone (Xiaomi mi 8) it worked without problems (except the overheating one that I think most phones suffer of). But now, on the Samsung S22 (Exynos) it has some really annoying crashes while in certain boss domains (example Signora). The boss would spawn only half (like only the head and the legs, and after getting to the 2nd phase, it completely freezes the game and the phone. So just 2* for the mobile vers. sadly.",20,"August 25, 2022",2
"Really fun game to distract you from stress, entertain you and help you interact with more people & gain new friends. Very interesting stories that make you want to watch it all as I've never skipped a single story. It's a very cool game and would certainly recommend to anyone into adventurous, interactive and entertaining games. My only small complaint is that it can be laggy sometimes but it might be cause of my device or my lack of storage. Overall it's a great game, solid 100/100.",14,"July 13, 2022",5
"Great characters, amazing music. There is one thing. For example it is very hard to get primogems but Project Sekai its very easy AND fun to get the get gems! I would like thag fixed because most of my friends (including me) uninstalled this app becauss we couldn't get the characters. Now I downloaded it again and lets hole it will be better. I want to see your opinion on this please.",0,"August 25, 2022",4
"Its really good! But whenever Dvalin appears the screen becomes glitchy, so I can't see or aim, I'm up to the part where you have to get rid of the blood clots on Dvalin, but I can't see, so it makes it impossible, Could you please fix it? I can't see, So I can't defeat the boss. If I can't defeat the boss I can't advance in the story. Theres also another weird glitch where when a water surface is frozen, I can't see the ice, But others can. Edit: Thanks so much the glitches have been fixed! :D",46,"August 23, 2022",5
"Perfect game for me. I love the characters, graphics, lore, music, strategy etc. It has tons of content but most of the content only needs to be done once instead of over and over again, so not grindy at all, which fits perfectly in my busy schedule. The game just keeps getting better and never fails to keep surprising me.",72,"August 10, 2022",5
"Absolutely love this game,the garphics ,the fights ,the story ,the characters i love it all. I definitely recommend this game to people who what an open world to explore,characters to upgrade , an amazing story as well as side quest to complete , puzzles to solve , daily content,etc. But good things come at a cost and for this it's storage😮‍💨. As well as a good phone and good wifi. But overall it's a nice game highly recommended.( resin system is TRASH).😁",2,"August 24, 2022",5
"Graphic,Music,Ost,Gameplay,Map,character design and especially the lore is excellent. It's a good game to relieve stress(unless you're a meta player). But the game is not optimized yet for most device (especially android). After each update,It's lagging. I hope they'll fix that in the future.",309,"September 11, 2022",5
"amazing video game, super addictive. The visuals are amazing, you get to explore a whole world, play as different characters, learn more about the character’s stories and do so many things! I especially love the storyline and visuals, even though im kinda behind on the archon quests.. i love rpgs and i like the unique battle styles. I wish there were ways to get primogems easier though..",21,"August 25, 2022",5
"I love the game. It's really fun to play, there's so much story, a lot of things to explore and find, but it gets a bit boring later. The gacha system takes ages&you barely get enough primogems from activities. Saving primos takes ages. And there's the lack of diversity; while the character designs are enjoyable and unique, there's no diversity in body types and skin color. Please do improve that! That&the slow-paced farming for materials are points of critique for an otherwise enjoyable game.",99,"July 13, 2022",2
"As someone who has played since launch, it can start to get tedious the longer you play it, as dailies become a repeat of doing coms, spending resin and logging out. What really gets me staying is the story, lore and worldbuilding, which is absolutely amazing. The open world is stunning too. I think the wishing system overall is fine. The artifact system however definitely needs more work. The resin also should have a shorter regeneration rate and a way to store excess resin like in Honkai.",860,"September 8, 2022",4
"Been playing since the first version, still my favourite game. Open world without everyone else running around in one server like hell, i like it with a vast map to explore myself and co op is optional. I can just immerse myself in the graphics, well structured storyline and lores. I love the music and voices, esp. in Korean. Despite very low probability of getting your favourite character..but a long-run f2p like me patient enough to save some primos can get a decent one time to time.",5,"September 1, 2022",5
"It's actually a beautiful game the graphics and quality is perfect! And the story line is also enjoyful and I love how everyone is making theories about the game! I really love the wishing animation too! This is a good work! And also I love the character designs, voice lines!. But I really hate this thing because the new version out is not available for my phone and it is not allowed in my phone so I can't really update it but now I can't play because of that please fix it I worked hard🙁",5,"August 28, 2022",2
"Cool, very fun, can't stop playing Edit: 50 adventure levels later and the game glitches for me to the point I can't play it, glitch makes it impossible to enjoy playing archon quests, because those big fights should be most fun right? Well because of the glitch that happens every time I do multiple attacks at once the game glitches to the point my phone overheats (and I'm not able to play anywhere other than a phone, and up until now I enjoyed this game too much) .. disappointed ... very.. fix",12,"July 15, 2022",5
"This game is honestly addicting but I quite enjoy it, thought there are a few problems I experience when using an Samsung phone who I wish they could change. For example, at times it gets a little laggy, I cant do weekly bosses because of how bad it lags, I can't see my damage, my yunjin lags whenever I click on her on the character menu or in coop. I'd really appreciate if that could be changed.",34,"July 31, 2022",4
"I love the game, the storyline, the art, the environment, the character designs, i just love everything abt this game. (edit : is it just me, or is the ""police detention center"" domain in inazuma bugged, cuz whenever i tried to enter it it'd just turn into a black screen and i even waited for it to load but it never loaded, ive tried to enter it again a few times but it still wont work)",83,"July 29, 2022",5
"This game is a big leap for mobile gaming. The other games were as I would call them ""a work in progress"". But, this this game is advanced in controls. This was meant for PS4, XBOX and PC but the developers worked hard to bring this game to Mobile players and they did not sacrifice a feature the game is almost as same as the one on consoles and pc. Best Graphics, gameplay and storyline. Must download!",350,"September 11, 2022",5
"Lacks endgame content, however the storyline and lore are good. I really like the concept of the promindial one and I really like the Sumeru Archon Quests so far. I would like this game if they gave NPC'S some regonization too, like Rana, Ying'er or Dunyarzard. It's exploration, graphics and world bosses are great too. I hate the concept of resin though, just a waste of time in my opinion. The game would be better if they removed the concept of resin and it being all luck-based.",8,"September 8, 2022",4
"No game is perfect, but Genshin Impact does set a high bar for future gacha games to compete with. It has tons of detail, the world is fun to explore, and the story and characterwork is great stuff. The only thing I take issue with in the game is the Gacha system, but I can forgive it somewhat. Characters are much more developed in the game. They're not just PNGs or stats. And I think it sort of justifies it compared to other ""friendlier"" gachas where what you pull for isn't exciting at all.",20,"August 15, 2022",5
"The game has a lot of bugs that hasn't been fixed yet. Most importantly the bug where the auto target messes up everytime when I use my burst, targeting measly slimes instead of other bigger enemies on the opposite side. Please fix hoyoverse. But aside from these dumb issues, the story and the art are just amazing and the music is mesmerizing",74,"August 24, 2022",4
"This game is unparalleled (atm) and has riveting gameplay. The story and world building blew my mind, they definitely invested into the lore of the game. Furthermore, the music is insanely good, they have a whole orchestra! The art, scenery, puzzles (some), and land architecture are all exquisite. My only critique is that there needs to be repeatable endgame content (preferably multiplayer) (abyss doesn't count), more beginner friendly, fairer weapon banners, and the skip feature!",69,"July 31, 2022",5
"the game is beautiful but it would be great if you add the italian language and make it easier to get primogems i will give 5 stars just in case :) Aside from that, the gameplay is well done and the characters with an interesting story too, the music is just as good so it deserves to be played. I write it to you in English, maybe so listen to the problems of the users...",18,"August 30, 2022",2
"Hi!! I love the game! The melodies, the sceneries, the cut scenes, the action, the characters, everything! I don't have any problems but today. Our WiFi network was suddenly not working while I'm playing so I've decided to stop for a bit but then when the wifi came back and I opened my account, all my progress are gone. Like I need to play it all in the very beginning. Pls fix this!!! :'(( Edit: OMG. I got my account back within a day! Good job. Keep it up. You deserve 5 stars 🌟💞",89,"August 9, 2022",5
"I LOVE THIS!!! the graphics are incredible, each character has it's own tailored writing, and the gameplay is extraordinary especially for a MOBILE GAME!! keep in mind it does take up quite a lot of space, so if you wish to have this game you should clear up some things beforehand. Overall it's really fun, but I have to take off a star because of how it can feel pay-to-win at times. Keep it up Devs!",30,"July 12, 2022",4
"I love genshin it's really cool and all. Biggest problem is the space it takes and the lags on mobile but overall the graphics are gorgeous, the characters are nice and the story is really interesting! There's a lack of content for end game players but the new nations that will come will surely make up for it (I hope–) also, Scaramouche banner when?? 😔😔😔",33,"July 15, 2022",4
"The game is overall amazing. The storyline, the plot and so on. My only problem is that it's unfair to people with a slow phone since sometimes, you can't see numbers or when there is a cutscene it stops and it's just annoying. Please fix these so we can have better experience",6,"September 2, 2022",4
"Its a great game and all, tons of quest to make yourself busy with and great landscape and characters! but my problem is how i cant see the damage texts. Though, im quite grateful for fixing the character and boss texture bug because it was quite a hassle playing the game. Can you also make damage texts possible for low end devices too? Thank you and have a nice day",14,"July 13, 2022",4
"Overall the game's good and the characters are pretty fun to play too, there are also events that keep you busy even though only for a few days. Though... I would like to say that, maybe it's me that's too fast, but everytime after I finish an event, it feels like there's nothing left to do except doing commissions and domains everyday. It gets pretty boring as it repetitively is like that.. But! Since it feels like it is my own fault, this game is still a recommend! edit: HEIZOU LESGOOOOOOOOOO",60,"July 13, 2022",5
"I really love playing Genshin Impact. Graphics, storyline, charachters and awarding system are well made. 3rd perspective needs some improvement i think, sometimes while fighting, after getting a hit, i can't see my character or my enemies anymore. 2nd problem I'm facing is aiming with gyroscope while playing in Amber character. Its rate of functionality is 12%. Rest is good for me, I'm getting to like the game more and more. Good job and keep it up.",11,"August 15, 2022",4
"The game is 10/10 really well designed with a lot of events and well writen quests, the songs are true masterpieces. The voice actors did a great job aswell.. on the other side the community is pretty bad and I mean it, they are one of the most toxic playerbase. Ofcourse there are some good people too but they are kind of rare. As a conclusion yes it is worth your time, the game is new player friendly and youtube is full of tutorials to help you when you are stuck somewhere",7,"August 30, 2022",5
"This game is awesome, You can explore the map and make friends too. Sure it's a bit laggy on mobile but overall a good game. But there's this one thing, when i see some bodys of water it keeps glowing to the point that it became too bright so I would have to look away. Please fix this.",48,"August 17, 2022",4
"i LOVE this game very much but there are a few issues that affect the gameplay of mobile users.firstly, we cant see the ice in the game whenever we freeze water. secondly, the damage numbers. the number of damage done cannot be seen on a lot of mobile players' phone and without seeing the damage, players will not be able to improve their characters' builds. lastly, the grass effect in the game which is just a flat piece of land.i hope these problems are resolved soon to allow a better experience",5,"September 9, 2022",4
"Edit: I have found the way to turn off speech in this game and it becomes immensely better. I am docking a star due to the option to turn off speech being locked behind completing a certain amount of the game, don't know why sound settings aren't edit-able from the beginning... so for that reason alone, the game will lose a star. It runs fairly smoothly, has interesting mechanics, will add more when I eventually play more of this game. Definately worth playing for at least a day.",56,"July 24, 2022",4
"The game is good. It has alot of content in it, the story line is awesome also characters changing mechanism is very fun. I also love the fact I could join other peoples world and play with them or help them. Farming artifacts, bosses, domains and etc is overwhelming experience. The downsides are the gacha system, if I really wanted a specific character im required to pull, which means it cost currency so theres a small chance of me getting a 5 star. I highly recommend it tho. It's free and fun.",1,"September 10, 2022",5
"I really love the game. They have this characters that looked awesome with their elemental skills, especially when you get to try the other characters when you don't have them, it feels like you really have the character. And the quests is also mind-blowing because it's connected to the story and new bosses to fight. My Favorite Quest in the Game is The Archon Quest because it is the main quest of the story and you get to know everything that had happened in their past life.",9,"August 23, 2022",5
"Ever since the 2.8 update, I can no longer see the enemies' health. At first I thought I could just deal with it until it gets fixed by itself, but it's getting really really annoying. I also can't see my damage numbers. It's a really fun game overall, but these few things make the gameplay experience... not so nice.",23,"July 16, 2022",4
"Give it 3 stars because when combat gets hectic, the touch screen controls fail me all the time. The camera also always moves it's way closest to the ground so I constantly have to keep fixing it while fighting. PLEASE BRING MOBILE CONTROLLER SUPPORT TO THIS GAME ITS A MUST FOR THESE TYPES OF GAMES WHICH HAVE A LOT GOING ON AT ONCE. Playing for more than an hour gives me cramps in my hands and the constant fixing of camera and mis-clicks makes me dread playing it sometimes",14,"August 14, 2022",3
"I've played since 2.4, The game is good, I don't really have much problems but it's nice, there's some problems sometimes that when you quest talk to other people, it kinda glitches and it takes a lot of time to load. But mostly I recommend this game if you like rpg and nice characters, the game Is fun and the characters have amazing designs, I really love this game! Hope you do more amazing updates in the future, I really really recommend this game for you to play if you are bored.",10,"September 6, 2022",5
"Been playing this game ever since its release and always looking forward for new regions. I definitely want to play till the end of this game. Graphics and designs are all gorgeous. Pulling for characters I wanted is what I love in this game, however, the genesis crystal purchase is too expensive. More than a hundred dollar in my currency but not even 1 pity (90 pulls). That's the only problem I have with the game so far. It makes me want to spend less honestly.",7,"August 23, 2022",4
"The storyline is just amazing. This is quite one of the best games I ever played in a while, the characters have a amazing design with a amazing backstory. The map is big with everything to explore! The bosses have a great design and an amazing attacks! Overall this is a amazing game. recommended! Edit: hoyoverse if you see this, there's a problem when I join the game. It kicks me out everytime I need to join the game, please fix it if possible.",27,"August 25, 2022",5
"Great game, playing on my a52, it plays great. Update after playing for over a year, it's a beautiful game with amazing graphics and movement. Great story and soundtrack. However it can get boring at times when there isn't any events or when you've caught up to the story. At most on a daily bases you have at best about 30 mins to and HR worth of play time, if so much. The game needs end game content and needs to be more generous with it's gacha.",2,"August 24, 2022",5
"positive: the game gets better with every update, it's hard to run out of things to do. however on the negative side, the storage is ridiculous. i've had to delete so much off my phone to fit all of the updates and i know i won't be able to download sumeru when it releases in a couple of months. it's really the only bad thing i have to say about the game, other than the prices and lag. if you get the £90 bundle it doesn't even get you to max pity. plus, even on the lowest graphics it lags a lot.",224,"July 13, 2022",4
"At first i played just because of a friend, but this game amazes me in so many ways. The intricate details in lore, the gorgeous scenery, the character designs, the enemy design as well and the fighting system (now with dendro introduced), this game just keeps getting better and better.",1,"August 24, 2022",5
"Best game I have ever played, it's so fun to play. Sometimes crashes and quality is not so good but despite that I have so much fun while playing this game. It takes lot of storage space so I haven't played it for a while since I don't have sufficient storage, storage space needed is too much for my device to process. Last year my device had to go for repairing due to this game download. BUT It never gets boring, I have been playing this game for about 2 years now..",1,"September 8, 2022",5
"Amazing character design, game with the best lore, amazing world building, a really fun mechanic, the graphic is top tier and i love the art style. The pity could be really frustrating sometimes specially when you lost your 50/50. But overall it's one of the best game. P.S: Please give us a generous rewards for the 2nd annivs, since the first annivs we only got few fate",0,"September 11, 2022",5
"The game is beautiful, the quality of story writing has improved recently. There's no questions for animation and music quality, they're top notch. Some of the filler contents such as this summer event is very entertaining. However, it should be noted that the game is unfinished and is created for casual gameplay. Therefore, it might become repetitive very quickly. Another donwside to the game is the heavy grinding for in-game mats that's RNG based.",6,"August 11, 2022",4
"The game is great. Fantastic lore and story of each character, The game mechanics is a bit boring since it only have two skills (Including burst that's literally in need of energy point to release with cooldown of around 15s) and repeated attacks but they're smooth so getting tired playing one (/four) character repeatedly can be almost impossible, and the minigames around the world is fine but the event is better and I hope some of them can stay forever.",6,"August 24, 2022",5
"Starting a new journey on a new map, only in this recent update my frame rate suddenly freezes for 0.4-0.5 seconds every 3 seconds, I've lowered my graphics a bit but it is still there, plss look into this & some tips to minimize or remove this short freezing, characters' movements are not catching up to what they're currently saying, a bit awkward right now =_=""",1,"August 28, 2022",4
"LOVE LOVE LOVE it, changed my phone and the running is smoother than ever 😩❤️ Love all the graphics, the audio, the new characters, the excitement! I'm not a person to play hardcore RPG games on my phone but this is another level of fun 😍 It can be idle, exciting, exhilarating, calm, funny and everything all at the same time. Loved it ever since I downloaded it last year - never to be deleted 🥰🥰🥰",3,"August 24, 2022",5
"When I try updating Genshin for the Sumeru update, it says pending, once I left my phone for 30 mins and when I came back it still said pending, please fix this!! Overal its a verry good game, good graphics and love the character designs, I also love the lore and little stories, its verry detailed and also love the cutscenes! There is some lag and sometimes I get kicked out of the game for no reason, so maybe try to fix that! <3",3,"August 24, 2022",4
"I liked the game really ! But the thing is when everytime I used my burst to fight mobs (slimes , hilichurls , etc) it's health bar kept disappearing , I could only see it if I used a burst or a different angle but it disappeared after which makes my gaming experience harder especially when I'm currently using mobile to play the game , it doesn't apply bosses since they're health bar is on top of the screen instead of being on top of it's head like the mobs , please fix this issue ! Thank you<3",31,"August 16, 2022",3
"I'm at an extremely dull phase, not even remotely excited for Sumeru and the End Game and quality of life is still non-existent. Content is getting so boring and there's zero challenge or stimulation. I wish the developers would listen to the players. I have no reason to continue buying the battle pass, all my characters are maxed out and there's 0 customization. I have 0 reasons to play with friends and I feel like the competition has better rewarding exploration. You need to level up!!!",29,"August 17, 2022",4
Still the best game for me but as time goes by it gets boring doing all the things repeatedly just to upgrade things that takes time to gain. It's a bit difficult I get burnout and stop playing for days (game break) and go back to same scene again. Upgrading things makes me want to sleep instead.,0,"September 11, 2022",4
"From my experiences this game is actually pretty good, a lot of fun. I find it beautiful and interesting. I like the open world feature and the story. There's just one problem that I encountered, sometimes when I open the app, the Hoyoverse intro pops up but nothing else after that. I can't open the game. The only way I could open again is to reinstall and it is such a pain to wait for the update to finish, but other than that the game is really good. I hope you will fix it soon.",63,"August 17, 2022",4
"I've been playing this game for almost one year and i don't miss on playing it everyday. First of all the story is really awesome and the scenery of this game is top tier. It's been one year and I'm still mesmerized with the scenery, sometimes when I'm bored I'm just running when doing commission to appreciate the scenery and the music is so beautiful.",10,"August 14, 2022",5
"The open world concept truly makes me feel like I'm traveling inside the game itself . The lore , characters , THE MUSIC and everything about this game is awesome ! Genshin is mostly single-player but you can choose to play multi at your own convenience . The updates are regular , coming at every 6 weeks . But yeah, if you're considering to be f2p , then just know this ... the rewards system is not that great and you'll need A LOT of self-control T-T . All in all, imo it's a great game ! <3",49,"August 24, 2022",5
"Played since launch and it's my favorite game extremely good story, character design, 5* drops are good compared with other gatchas (because there's a guarantee) and I love the map exploration. The only problem is the 1st aniversary rewards they were not good anough even though they were redone it still wasn't enough, still hoping for good rewards on 2nd anni",16,"August 5, 2022",5
"THE GOOD: Good game, addictive, fun, good characters and nice graphics, the combat system is fun and the animations are cool, the gacha is OK but free prymogems are hard to grind. / The BAD: Censorship sucks, progression system is too slow, resin system is very limited and the artifact grinding is annoying and tiring, any other grinding is just like any other gacha but again resin is hard to get and slow to recharge.",32,"July 13, 2022",3
"ITS A AMAZING GAME!! it has outstanding graphics and it's entertaining because you always have something to do, but the one problem I have is that it takes a long long long long time to download things, I don't care about how hard the pulls are, that's how the game works but I'm just a little impatient about downloading stuff so that's my only complain otherwise it's the best game I've played yet :)",9,"August 24, 2022",4
"This game is an absolute masterpiece! The music the artstyle, the storyline, everything! It's just too perfect. I really hope they add a cross-save feature through servers in the future so I could play with my friends in another nation without losing progress.",3,"August 28, 2022",5
"My journey through teyvat has been great! Tho i experience some few bugs before like when an enemy is almost dead the health comes back and then when fishing bar is already full it still goes on, but it doesnt really bother me because it only happens sometimes but i hope you can fix it in version 3.0!! Goodluck Grinding Again Everyone!",11,"August 24, 2022",5
"The game is very high quality in presentation; the level of polish exceeds almost all mobile games and can even be compared to console titles. The downfall would be the rest of the game, gameplay as well as the mechanics. It may be unique but ends up tedium filled in the long term.",9,"August 14, 2022",3
"The game is totally worth it. Amazing graphics, characters and game play. I only owe to point out that the game needs all of my device's storage. Other than that, I encourage the developers to keep doing the Amazing work they've been doing for the past years!",0,"August 22, 2022",5
"I love this game!! I've been playing since June of 2021 and I've loved it since then. My only problem is how much storage it takes up especially if your a mobile player, like myself, and sometimes it won't work and will kick me off the app after I got a new phone. But those are my only two complaints, the game itself is SUPER fun, great characters, amazing story line, and you can play with other people too. Truly my favorite game!",1,"August 24, 2022",5
"Genshin Impact is a really good game. I immediately liked it when I started playing. I like the graphics, the character designs, the gameplay, and the functions of the game. I just hope that we can clip, sink and float objects in the serenitea pot. The serenitea pot allows players to be creative and make their own ideas and I hope that we can be more free about it. Nevertheless, the game is probably one of the best games that I've ever played:)",35,"August 23, 2022",5
"The graphic and storyline was great! But one thing. I install this game to have fun, not to think hard. Some events really need you to think hard so I don't really like it. I don't know with other players whose have brilliant IQ, but for a normal human as me, I can't follow the events well",0,"August 18, 2022",5
I enjoy the game alot but elemental reactions and the buffs are a bit confusing sometimes and my characters are kinda weak for my world level but overall it's one excellent game. It could be more better if the amount of storage it takes up would be less. It would be better if they made this game on more devices (nintendo switch etc.).,50,"August 17, 2022",5
"Constant updates, fast bug fixes, interesting story and great characters. I still play this daily, and i really enjoy all the events. There's some things that are kind of iffy like the ratio of 5* to 4* (more 4* characters please), several layers of rng, and the ratio of male to female characters (much more females) among some other things, but I am hoping they'll get addressed in the future updates.",4,"July 28, 2022",4
It's a great app I have played genshin for about a year and I still loved it just as much when I started. It is hard to collect premogems when u are f2p so it's very tempting to spend money (witch I have and do not regret) its fun entertaining and has a great story line. It's a casual game so if u grid it to much u can become burnt out or board. But I would 10/10 recommend this. It's so addictive in a good way bc u can explore all the lore and different story's as well as (hot) characters. :),0,"September 9, 2022",5
"I love it!I almost play it everyday. You can choose graphic quality, Change the voice line into other languages,all the character is cool, somethings basics and more! But..the problem is That when I wanna fight or go on adventures sometimes it start to get lag and I got out of the game for no reasons and I hope you will release Venti Banner... Ehe😅. That's all! 🥰",130,"July 22, 2022",4
"I really love this game and have been playing since day one. I really love all the characters and the designs. The co op system is really nice and fun so you can play with friends; however, it sound be updated and improved because it can be a lot better. Really awesome combat system. It's graphics are absolutely stunning. I can't wait for more💖",1,"August 24, 2022",5
"Game is fun. But the game does not want me to play with new characters. Acquiring a character is very expensive unless you choose to skip many. And after acquiring, it takes weeks to be able to get them up to the level of my other characters. I just want to play with the new exciting stuff!... but I can't until I do the required farming. This isn't a game, it's a job",6,"September 6, 2022",2
Very amazing. For a mobile game this this pack a lot of things. Truly amazing. But i put 4 star because 1. Swapping character during combat is unintuitive due to the fact that only three slot were shown. This make the order jumbled 2. The lip sync won't be soo hard to be fixed. Considering the amount of revenue this game have. I won't be surprised if a whole software were develop to make the lip sync with each different languages Other than that this game is amazin,49,"August 24, 2022",4

"An incredible open-world game with beautiful characters, landscapes and ost that runs well on mobile but as someone who plays for the combat, levelling and exploration aspects of this game the ludicrous amounts of dialogue that I have to sift through in order to progress and unlock new areas (look I know this is a story-driven game but it wouldn't hurt to add a button that skips dialogue which 90% of games in this genre have) sadly ruins it for me.",1,"September 1, 2022",2
"This game is fantastic, I am AR 45 who keep making new acc, I well like to give some idea, can you please add an option where you can skip the whole dialogue/Cutscene? That will make the game much faster for those player who keep making an acc and getting impatient because of how long the cutscenes/dialogoe, there is also a problem where it get glitchy on some cutscenes, maybe because my phone is low device, can you try and find a way to fix it? Ty.",16,"July 22, 2022",4
"So far so good, a bit laggy sometimes but overall it's good. The only problem is that it randomly kicks me out of the game? I don't know why, my internet is fine and my phone could manage it well yet it just kicks me out randomly. It's getting a bit more annoying especially when I'm actually getting into the story.",0,"September 11, 2022",3
"I really love this game, and it has been able to run on my chromebook. Though, recently it kept crashing before I could even see the Pyro icon turn gray. I've checked for missing files, cleared the cashe for the game and even unintalled and re-installed it. I've also restarted my chromebook a multitude of times, yet nothing has been able to work. I'm not sure if this a problem on my part, but I would like if this issue could be resolved.",27,"August 13, 2022",3
"Overall, it's a great experience. Enjoyed the game for a while till it gets a bit repetitive. The game has a really huge map to explore (including time-limited maps) with beautiful landscapes. The music and character designs are amazing! The resin system and the gacha rates are pretty underwhelming.. and yeah, thats all..",30,"August 24, 2022",4
"It's really fun, you can play with your friends and explore, there's also a lot of fun events and it gives a lot of primogems, i am also excited about the new sumeru update.

"I'm playing genshin for about half a year now and all I can confirm is that the graphics are beautiful! The first stories like the Mondstadt and Liyue archon and side quests were really entertaining when I first experienced them. The character designs and mechanics of each one is sort of easy to comprehend but an average person can understand enough to get by. I'd also like to say how I dislike how low the resin cap, which is a pretty big issue, and how the teapot function has limits, like load.",33,"August 18, 2022",4
"I absolutely love it! This game is really beautiful. Its really fun, you can do alot of things here. I really recommend this game. Its really addicting, you can interact with alot of travellers. You can collect alot of new characters, its really great, The map is so massive and theres alot of things to do! You can attack creatures and other things!

"Started recently and I've taken a good liking to it. So much to explore and not a boring experience at all. Just one thing, even at the lowest setting... I get frame drops. That maybe a regional problem. But otherwise, love the game and the grind.",23,"July 26, 2022",5
No controller support for Androids. That is the only disappointment. Other than that it's a good game and I play mainly on my PC rather than mobile because the mobile version is not really efficient and the play style is not great either which would be easier if I have a controller and I do except it doesnt support controller for Androids which I think is unfair. If you have controller support for iPhone why not Androids as well.,1,"September 6, 2022",4
"This game is such an amazing RPG game I've ever played..The graphics, music, scenery, and the background effects are so awesome.. I'll give you a 5 star..But can you fix the crash and the crit text, ice bridge, and grass for a potato phone because i already get the graphics to the highest one but still can't see the numbers and so on..also it's so disturbing when i was playing coop with friends and suddenly it crashed..I already clear my storage, caches and everything but still crashing like omg",6,"August 19, 2022",5
"its really fun and addicting but one thing is that you have to have a really good device and alot of storage to be able to play it at all. alot of events and stuff to do, you can be multiplayer and make friends which is nice. though one con for that is the friend limit needs to be higher. (also really tempting to spend money on)",11,"August 15, 2022",5

"The game is really good. But the optimisation is a little bit bad, because you really need a powerful phone to play it with nice graphics and good FPS, I have redmi note 8 phone and I can't get a stable 30 frams even at the lowest settings and that's annoying because I love the graphics of this game But that's the only issue a have everything else is perfect and I love it",1,"August 23, 2022",4
"I like the game, its great and I love it. But I have a huge problem with the graphics, the graphics are fine. But for some reason, whenever I wan't to talk, pick up, fight or even just run, my screen always end up pausing, it will play when I wait like 15 minutes or I restart, but that is not everything. My wifi is good, and its show's I'm on 50ms, but it suddenly goes up to 200 even tho I just clicked sprint, basically. Also, when I try to fight, my game always pauses, I like the app. Pls fix.",64,"August 13, 2022",3
"Best game ever. I started playing this game back in May 5, 2021, I fell in love with this game ever since. Some suggestions though, Please add more options for both basic and advance graphical settings like an option to turn on or turn off grass animations or just remove the grass entirely, Make the graphics settings more separate so that we could go through the settings more deeper, Add the ""Low"" shadows from the PC version, And add ambient occlusion. Thanks.",15,"July 20, 2022",5
"The rank ascendsions shouldn't be so much of a frustration to just continue the storyline and seem to be a way of getting players to quit playing due to difficulty. Don't get me wrong, it's a lovely game, but to do thr storyline only for there to be places where adventure rank locks seems counterproductive when it is used to progress story",3,"August 24, 2022",4
"A very good game with good graphics, superb music and a wonderful story. However, it is clear to me that the people working on this game have no intention of diversifying the character roster. Hoyo continues to take from other cultures to inspire its nations, and yet cannot go beyond 2 skin tones. This game would be much better if new characters had more skin tone diversity.",5,"August 25, 2022",3
Why is there no Gamepad support on mobile!? It's been more than 2 years and still no controller support on Android. Seriously! With all the money this game makes it's unbelievable. I have a bluetooth controller for android and multiple Xbox One controllers and I don't understand why they don't work for this game. Seriously needs it. I have a S20 and even with such a big screen I find I accidentally jump when trying to attack or plunging when I was trying to stop gliding. It's annoying.,28,"August 6, 2022",2
"The game is really interesting, it's slow-paced, every important thing or feature is introduced slowly and overtime. The only issue I have with the game is the amount of space it uses. New updates always require huge amounts of space needed and that means I have to start deleting other app data or uninstalling apps to be able to update the game.",0,"August 23, 2022",5
I love this game really it's amazing and I love following the story but the more I go into it the more glitchy and slow the game becomes and everytime I have to talk to a character it takes forever until it actually works and I've also fallen out of the world multiple times know and I don't even dare trying to teleport places anymore cause by the time I actually get to the place it would've been faster to just run there. If you don't have a really good phone don't bother downloading this game,21,"September 9, 2022",1
"I love this game. It's an adventure game, with beautiful scenery, an amazing storyline, and cool combat. I like how you can make every choice your own, even in NPC dialogue. There is such a range of things you can do, and I would highly recommend the game. It doesn't have ads, but it requires WiFi. The download/update time is roughly 20 minutes, depending on the size. I hope you enjoy the game, and hope that my review helps. Have a great day.",6,"August 4, 2022",5
"I love the new place, Sumeru so much~ I found it accidentally, and it was so cute and unique💕 very nice design, rounds of applauses to design team.

Keep up the great work!",0,"September 4, 2022",5

"I love the game, it's beautiful, the story line's are amazing, it's brilliant. But honestly, it takes up way too much space, and takes way too long to download. It's not even done yet and takes up half my storage. I feel like when it's finished, you'll need nothing else on your phone but Genshin Impact just because of the storage needed. Other than that I love the game",100,"July 13, 2022",3
"The game is fantastic, I never had this Much fun, they need to add more content. It takes them a while to add new content plus they need to add more different features,To make it even more enjoyable for f2p players.

Other than this is definitely one of the best games you can play on mobile.",23,"July 29, 2022",5
Very fun game! I only wish for more freemogems. The game updates frequently and it has plenty of events! (Altho I'm still hoping for Scaramouche to release lol!) It has a lot of nice charecters and the story and art is wonderful! (Edit: power creeping is kinda a issue and the rates are a but annoying btu other then that still highly recommend!

I hope they will soon have linux support too 😊",8,"August 24, 2022",5
"I don't usually play this game as often as I do with other game, but sometimes when I do play I usually do some side quests for awhile. Although some of the main quests are kinda hard to complete so I could use some hints, but other then that it's a fun game and the character selection and their different abilities are interesting and sometimes useful.",8,"July 13, 2022",5
"They added a new region and some strange quality of life upgrades. Sumeru gives players a lit more things to do and that aranyaka quest takes hours to complete, but it doesn't solve the overall underlying issue that genshin still doesn't have an endgame, or difficult content. Changes in the wish, resin or artifacts randomizer systems would have been preferred instead of the wood collector thingy. Contrarily, dendro is an awesome element, and seeing new game mechanics is absolutely phenomenal.",7,"September 2, 2022",4
"I have enjoyed this game so much since then moment I've started playing. I play on both ps4 and Mobile and it works so well. The game has amazing storyline, game play and character design. The game is still in development however I've never experienced any bugs personally and have been playing for a bit. The game also works fairly well with bad wifi meaning it doesn't restrict many players from being able to play.",8,"July 30, 2022",5
"I've been playing it for 2 years, the game itself is fun. There's a lot to do in it, from exploring, to puzzle solving, to quest lines that are part of the base game. Then you have events that add more to the aforementioned stuff above. Music is outstanding, quite atmospheric. Graphics are nice and pleasant to the eyes. Unfortunately the RNG that comes from the gacha system, artifact type and stats plus the stamina function, keeps this game from being a 5 star.",7,"August 24, 2022",4
"The best game. It's free, and as an F2P player I didn't really experienced any inconveniences. It has good graphics, an anime style game which is different from others.

They both have a different art style they should know that before saying it.",0,"August 24, 2022",5
"sumeru's archon quest and lore are great! they're a time sink but they aren't rushed and explain a lot of important stuff. i hope that more plot-heavy stories can be permanent and not locked behind time-limited events. as for the exploration in sumeru, the entire region is fun to explore. it's interesting and new but not annoying like inazuma. the main thing i'd criticise are the character designs. many of the characters don't feel accurate to the cultures that they're inspired by.",8,"September 3, 2022",4
"I absolutely love this game on the PS5 and mobile. Though, on the phone it can lag a little, it's nothing too serious. I truly recommend this game to those who like open world, combative games. It has engaging storylines, plenty of things to do while in between main storyline quests and amazing characters. The lore is fascinating and the combat itself is beautiful. The graphics are better on the PS, but that doesn't mean that they're bad on mobile. Try it, you will love it. You don't have to pay",2,"August 8, 2022",5
"This game is visually and audibly pleasing to play. From smooth graphics, to an immersive storyline and many relatable characters to love and adore, this game is definitely one of a kind.

"Honestly one of the best rpg ever it's got constant updates with fun events, super cool characters each very unique, super interesting lore, the voice actors are amazing at what they do. The game also gives each player a chance to build characters however they want the scenary in the game is also beautiful. The only issues I've seen with the game is drop rates are too low and it's pretty hard to get good artifacts but it still happens eventually u just gotta grind for good stuff. 100% recommend",95,"August 25, 2022",5
"(Updated review) Thanks for reply. The main thing that I want to see in future that, there should be a dedicated 'skip' buttons for the dialogues and also the puzzles should be more specific and accurate( Because the recent puzzle is hard to solve due to not enough information about how to synchronise properly). Please add some kinds of mount such as horse or a unicorn to explore more effectively. There should be some permanent events like the ""wind trace""(Maybe you can add this in teapot).",20,"July 18, 2022",3
The game is fantastic and I love it with all my heart. But one thing I don't like personally is ascending characters. If you don't do it before your world Level increases your screwed in a sense.

"Artifact RNG in general is terrible, but what I hate the most about it is the drops. Allow us to choose what artifact set we want to get before farming the domain. Imagine if this nonsense also happened with talent book domains, I don't think anyone would even play this game.

I'm still not past it due to immense amounts of lag the screen is also blank. I have no clue what happend either.

Great game for casual playong- lots of fun storyline and Activites in all stages of the game. Some issues with graphics quality on mobile are present but they don't take away too much from the actual gaming experience. I would recommend this game to anyone who has around 30-40 minutes a day to play and is not prone to over-playing or grinding as those two habits take away from the sense of adventure and fun in the game.,3,"July 13, 2022",4
"It's really great as a story, the gameplay fells awesome, the combat Is amazing, the fact that it has no ads is also a big win in them, the gatcha is a bit annoying but I have managed to be able to clear many stuff as a F2P, and speaking of F2P, It being free means if you don't like it, you don't lose much, also, pretty much every character is hot is a big win for me",0,"August 18, 2022",5
"For newer players, this game is really entertaining as it goes. Though for late players or as your so-called journey continues the more you play, the more it gets a little bit stressful. Then it adds up and adds up to the point were there's no other interesting content to be a involved in. This may not be for everyone but a really huge majority of the players either quit the game or not play for a while. This is because their is literally nothing interesting do after beating the game.",20,"August 23, 2022",5
"by far the BEST gacha rpg i've ever played. amazing graphics and scenarios, irntesting lore and characters, exellent music and VA (all languages, i've tryed them all). the artefacts system is well balanced, although it can get a bit frustraiting at times, and the gacha system in one of the best. the events are super fun and have good rewards. only problem is that playing on mobile can potentially ruin the experience since the game could lag (a lot). but that's not their part,so definitely 5/5",7,"August 23, 2022",5
"The game itself if great. But it's annoyingly cruel is you're a good sniper. Even if you got a character from far away, their health just regenerates.

Like waaaay too much rambling by characters.",1,"August 25, 2022",3

"You can finish your dailies under 20 minutes and then explore the world or level-up your characters. It's like being part of your favorite show. Every region is like a new season of the show, and the lore and stories of characters are very nice.

I sometimes want to ignore the enemies or strategise in harder content like Spiral Abyss, I might want to target an enemy.",1,"August 24, 2022",5

I hope you like the game too!",3,"July 23, 2022",5

Still have alot of issues and some characters have problems that has still not been fixed for 2 years, and some being minor not being fixed.

i love this game so much.Everything about it is great but personally i don't like the adventure rank ascensions because i've been stuck on the first one and i can't beat the domain. I've done it about 10 times and i cant beat the electro hypnostasis even with help from videos and i just want to do the archon quests ect. And some players believe it's too hard.,10,"July 28, 2022",4
"The combat of the game is engaging and enjoyable, however there's not enough. If something like labyrinth warriors was turned to a permanently playable mode then the game would get more recognition and would keep players wanting to play. For veteran players there is nothing to do and the players may drop the game especially with other game releases. The perilous trail event would be close to perfection if it was permanent and the game would truly be 5★... Hopefully not limited though.",13,"July 27, 2022",3
"It is a very well executed game, theres so many characters, and stuff! The story itself is very interesting. Tho when you're using phone, its rather grassless...and low quality, theres also no numbers of the total hit you have done, i got heizou and whenever I do his ultimate the bar of the monsters or whoever I am fighting dissappears. Well, although it is like that I enjoy the game! You should download it!",0,"August 24, 2022",4
"This game is definitely trying to make you spend money on it, and people who are free-to-play like me are definitely getting the shaft in a few ways, but overall this game has improved in a variety of ways. The exchange rates of real money to in-game characters, items, and currency are still atrocious. Worth your time, not your wallet.",12,"August 24, 2022",4
"Since the desired artifacts are difficult to obtain, I think that Hoyoverse should create a system where we are allowed to reset the artifacts that have been upgraded from level 20 to level 1 again, this will make it easier for us to obtain the appropriate stats for each character. I really like this game and have been playing since patch 2.0, I hope this game continues to grow successfully.",0,"August 21, 2022",5
"Beautiful game. Played from the beginning, still the best cross platform game of all time. The music, graphic, character, scenery, combat, story, gameplay, animation, everything is just perfect. They also outdid themself on every update. 10/10. Thank you Hoyoverse!",2,"August 29, 2022",5
"This game is one of my favorites and way back when, I pretty much played none stop, but now I'm doing other things and sometimes when I do have a chance to go on it doesn't work 100 %, mostly in multiplayer mode, it mostly just glitches out here and there time to time. But overall, this game is my favorite and probably will always be my favorite! ^^ I may one day make another account to restart for fun, but who'll know? Anyways! I highly recommend playing this game! With or without firends, bye!",7,"July 13, 2022",5
"I like the concept of the game alought and the characters are very fun to use. My only problem with it is the fact that once your character has reached level 20, it becomes very difficult to try and ""ascend"" to higher levels. Kind of wish that the level up system in the game would have no requirements, just using what you find and improving them without the need of ""ascension"". Other than that, games amazing.",85,"July 13, 2022",4
"this game is a 10/10 with story telling and the graphics look beautiful, I don't even know what to say, it is truly amazing, and each time I've gotten a new account for co-op stuff i see the very start of the game again and I'm so blown away, also the mobile version is as easy to use as pc, which I appreciate so much as someone with an old slow pc, it is so easy to have fun in this game, world quests make the world so much more alive, the general story is beautiful and emotional, amazing.",2,"August 12, 2022",5
The game really know how to impress me. I really love the world exploration as well as other ingame feature such as the housing system. Not forget to mention there are lots of fun event eventhough they are limited-time event like the windtrace(hide and seek) and theater mechanicus(tower defense). I really hope the dev team can bring back those event. Although the game could use some improvement as there is not a lot to do for endgame player since the content is limited.,1,"July 21, 2022",4

"Love it! I can spend hours playing this game and still not get bored. I highly recommend the side quests, you will need to build your AR up for the story quests but even the side quests are fun and can get a bit stressful at times as well. It has a good mix of both. Absolutely hate Dragonspine but the quests there are so much fun and the Ruin Guards will be the death of me one of these days. Lol. But once I pick this game up, I don't want to put it down.",4,"July 27, 2022",5
"If you have a game that you want to grind. This game is great for it's fighting combat system and characters. It's pretty grind based and it takes a long time just to get a 10 pull. Since there are many characters you'll have to wait for the characters you want because they have to rerun. The biggest problem is the storage because it takes up a lot of storage. 16GB for this game. As more regions release, it's gonna take up more space and since some mobile players have barely enough storage.",32,"August 24, 2022",4
"Game is great, really PC level of gameplay and enjoyment on mobile. Sadly, this game has huge problems such as: horrible RNG artifact system, awful wishing system, bugs not being fixed even a year after launch, bad balancing between characters and non-interesting endgame gameplay. By the time you've finished up the story quests you might as well wait another year for new story quests. With that being said, its fun factor is unlike any game I've played on mobile.. so I guess it deserves 5 stars..",19,"August 22, 2022",5
"I played since itto was released and during my stay in here i'm going to give it a 5 star because the storylines the characters the rewards the graphics it really is like another world the rewards are a bit dissatisfaction but overall its good sadly i fear that i would stop playing in the future since the updates/storage are getting bigger and my phone won't be able to catch up, i'll get a latop soon! , By the way to those who wants to try this i HIGHLY encourage you to do so its very fun!",0,"September 5, 2022",5
"Fantastic! This game is actually very well made. It'll definitely keep you hooked and coming back for more. So far, I haven't experienced any advertisements or the game forcing me to buy something in order to move forward. The graphics look great and the game runs very smoothly. Highly recommend to anyone looking for an Adventure/RPG. Initial download will be very large so do it over Wi-Fi.",3,"July 14, 2022",5
"This game is thoroughly enjoyable, especially since you get enough incentives to continue playing as a free-to-play player and are not forced to pay for advancement. This is the first time i have willingly put some money into a game, because im so impressed with the graphics, soundtrack and overall gameplay.",3,"July 13, 2022",5
"Best game in the Play Store. This is an actual game not like other games in The play store (either very simple or monetizing your time through ads). Everything is amazing; the story, character design, music, and world building. The world in the game is vast and beautiful. And the best part is that you can play as much as you want. You don't have to wait for stupid things in the game to recharge so you can play; like stamina... In short: yes, download the game, I promise you will not regret it.",7,"July 20, 2022",5
"The game is absolutely astonishing . First the game offers a massive world to explore and so many quests and objectives that it is impossible to get bored while playing, there is always tons of stuff to do. Second, it is true that being a free to play player isin't easy, I've been playing the game for about 1.5 years (currently AR 43), but it doesn't mean that the game is anything but pure entertainment and fun. Thank you miHoYo for this great game and continuous updates.",0,"August 18, 2022",5
"A quality free to play experience, even at late game. I've been fairly lucky with pulls so fortunately I have a few good characters to pick from, what I lack is good weapons. Even with that said, I clear everything so you really don't *need* to spend money on this game, and unlike most mobile titles this is *actually* a game. Beautiful world, amazing soundstage, great voice acting, lovely diversity of character to collect, passable story. Works well on mobile, but better on PC/console. Ganyu/10",0,"August 24, 2022",5
"In my opinion, this game is the best rpg I've played in a long time, and that's a lot coming from me because I play A LOT of rpg games, this game has all kinds of monsters to fight while still giving you the chance to follow the main story line, you don't get stuck in the story if you get bored, there's different quests and things to find. Overall the game is great and I totally recommend!, The only issue is it takes up a LOT of space so it's hard to pay it often did to not enough space",8,"August 27, 2022",4
"Absolutely gorgeous, the game itself has amazing lore, characters and interesting designs. Not to mention the world itself it's so pretty, tho sometimes it lags from time to time, I just lower some graphics to make it smoother with render. Also it's free to play! You can pay to get new characters from a gacha wish banners, but I suggest to just be patient and have fun playing!",0,"August 21, 2022",5
"Amazing game, loads to explore and do and every update there is something new to do and updates come out every 6 weeks. However, the gacha system is awful, even though it is possible to get new characters free to play, it requires either a lot of luck or A LOT of money, it also suffers from not having much to do in the end game, where nothing posses a challange and getting new characters is much harder. Overall its an amazing game, but would be much better if it wasn't for the gacha system",48,"July 18, 2022",3
This game is absolutely amazing and astonishing. I would recommend It to those who want to explore and not just be forced by the story to progress. There a some downside the summon are low and the fragment to get them for free are hard as well. So if u want to spend some money you can but it's not required,3,"August 2, 2022",5
"The storyline is simply amazing! The heroes design could be slightly better as well as the colors. The gameplay is really fun, exploring is fun as hell. I really enjoy grinding even though some people call it boring. Overall 9/10, nothing is perfect.",1,"August 25, 2022",5
"this game is perfect, I cant describe my words are too long. I like the english, it thought me lot of new vocabulary. I like the graphic, music, characters, story. the only thing dv should add is little tutorial or bigger hint for some puzzles, theyre sometimes confusing, even more to newbies",3,"July 13, 2022",5
"This game is an absolute masterpiece, it is so addictive and fun to play, but there's is one problem that is annoying me. As a player who plays on mobile, I experienced glitches on the appearances of the bosses, It took me ages to pass the quest ""Confront Stormterror"" but I finally beated it yesterday and was overjoyed. But that feeling didn't last long as the new villian/boss's appearance was also glitched. This disappointed me, I hope it can be fixed. Atleast childe's appearance is ok lol.",19,"August 24, 2022",4

I still love the game and i will keep playing (R.I.P Storage)!",0,"August 23, 2022",5
"This is a great game that was made not just for profit, but for the purpose of a fun and enjoyable experience. There are micro transactions, but everything can be unlocked without spending a penny. My only complaint is the game has performance issues on mobile devices, even on the latest models, it still has lag on high graphics settings. Other than that it's a good game, it's well made, and it's fun to play.",1,"September 8, 2022",4
"The game itself is perfect, the story is interesting and others, the game mode is also interesting. But for an example, a problem: when I started playing, I got kujou sara in the gacha system, but her ascension materials are in Inazuma, this makes person get the character ""stuck"" in a certain level. Like, imagine that someone starts playing, the 7 nations are released, and the person gets one character from the last nation, the person really won't be able to use the character.",3,"July 24, 2022",4
"Oustsanding music fit in their respective environment. Relaxing graphics, makes me come back to this game now and then. Damage mechanics quite unique, and also lot of puzzles to solve. Second game ? Absolutely, First game ? kinda boring once you reach end game. But events worth to come back to.",1,"August 10, 2022",5
The update is great the atmosphere and music are just great in sumeru a lot of new features that are really helpful in exploring althou there are minor bugs like sometimes mobs guarding a chest disappears but it's an easy fix if you restart the game the new chracters have a really good design and the story has been pretty great so far. A great update indeed.,0,"August 25, 2022",5
"I'd rate this game a solid 3.5/5 all things considered It's super fun and I love the art and graphics, combat and story. One issue with this game is the paywall; you shouldn't have to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars to ""fully"" unlock a five star and c6 them and you shouldn't have to spend hundreds on a weapon banner just to get the weapon you want. The other issue is they are way too slow at releasing story quests for a company profiting millions off their game.",2,"July 13, 2022",4
"Surprising amount of content for a FREE game. So much exploration, events every month, engaging lore, and likeable and interesting characters. The only problem with the mobile version is how intense it is on performance, this is one of those battery drainer games. But I highly reccomend the game for the 100s of hours of content.",0,"August 30, 2022",5
"This is a wonderful game with beautiful graphic and lore. Much for a new player to do and discover. Only probably I have are the controls. They're to large and very sensitive. It would be nice to choose the size, style, and sensitivity of the control. Overall, I love this game",0,"August 16, 2022",5
"Good polished game, and sets a new standard. But gets really repetitive. Events feels more like another amusement park you have visited before. Many things are simply recycled from assets that exists from launch, for example character animations used in new story cutscenes are obviously old ones. It feels very amateurish and low budget, even source film maker creators put more effort than this. Developers have gained their money already, and seems to change their focus to the new projects.",1,"August 13, 2022",3
"Superb game I ever played in my life. Story line up in the game was insane. Literally it was Awesome in any category (graphics, characters, the way of adventures done by the traveller, sounds and music, Weapons,.. etc) But actually I am expecting that to change the data of the user to any other server(manually / by request), because it will definitely help us to play even with other server players by connecting them with the game. I hope may be in future they will think about it.🔥💧💨🪨☘️❄️⚡⚔️",3,"July 19, 2022",5
"Its great! However when i test the game on tablets/mobile phones, it crashes. I know that phones and tablets arent the best for Genshin but whatever!Mostly, I have to clear the cache for it to stop crashing, as said on Google, ""How to fix tablet crash on Genshin Impact"". Overall, great game and cool characters, Although i suggest u make more easier ways to get intertwined fate and more primogems, it could be a struggle for lower adventure rank players, a result of wanting their first five star.",1,"August 2, 2022",4
"It's an amazing game, but I do have some complaints, it's pretty hard to get your ar to rank up, almost everything that isn't the story is rng based , and most character people want are only available for a limited run, making it really hard to get. And it takes alot of storage on mobile Some ways I think this game could improve is to make all characters added to the standard banner, and make there banner just a higher chance of getting them, and to reduce the size of the game on mobile",0,"August 23, 2022",4
"Great game. I love playing and the daily commissions, story quests, Archon quests, etc are enjoyable. The scenery is beautiful and every region is unique. New stuff comes out every month or so and the game doesn't get boring. I like the story and the objectives are clear. Character and boss designs are great.

"Stepping into Genshin Impact I wasn't sure quite what to expect, but as I played more I quickly fell in love with the game and began enjoying it thoroughly. I was hesitant on the multiple character switching in the beginning but the mechanic quickly grew on me. I thoroughly am enjoying this game and it is an amazing game for a mobile experience. There is plenty of hours of content available! Please add controller support for Android as it would help a ton! Keep up the amazing work!",12,"August 29, 2022",4

"Starting to take up too much space on phone with each update. MHY needs to do better with developing the mobile platform separately from pc and ps platforms.

"The only game I did not uninstall on my phone. Been playing for almost year now and I'm constanstly in awe of how much effort (and budget) is being thrown into this very f2p friendly game. The lore, the world building is incredible for a mobile game. Of course it would pale in comparison to other PC games. Like obviously it would but for someone like me who cant spend hours just leisurely playing games, GI is worth it as you dont need to spend so much time on it in order to advance.",3,"July 13, 2022",5
"Been playing for awhile, it's a great game :) Definitely recommend if you have enough storage. There's so many things you can do from fighting cool monsters, unlocking new stories, new areas along teyvat, and fun events. The one thing that I wish could be changed is that you can move your data to a different server/delete only one account instead of both if on one Gmail. Other than that it's definitely worth a try. ^^D",6,"August 23, 2022",5
"As of now, the state of the game isn't really changed. Many days had passed and it's still the same old genshin, even the battlepass isn't changed and it's almost 2 years. I don't really know what to say but all the updates are only for stories, characters and weapons and not for the improvement of the game and the enjoyment of the players who seeks excitement through gaming everyday. It's just a simple routine everyday and it's fine for me since I don't have much time but for others it isn't.",2,"August 24, 2022",4

I literally play this game every day, it's an addiction at this point haha But seriously, the only danger of this game is that you'll develop a dependence on it... well, and it can make your phone pretty hot and drain battery.

Please atleast add a skip button for dialogues so more players like me will feel encouraged to get back in the game. Then ill rate this a 5 star.",2,"July 12, 2022",2
The game has everything u can be looking for in a game. It's puzzles really develop your creativity. The main story is just too good and so exciting.

"Eh. It's alright. For a free game at least. The lore and characters are both very well writtena and are super interesting, but unfortunately the storytelling in the game itself is absolute garbage. They spend the entire quest doing absolutely nothing relevant and then at the end they just make a cutscene with a twinge of uh.. ""emotion"" in it. Like the chasm for example! Great concept, awful delivery. Hoyo, nobody wants to play a boring game. Hire better writers, I'm sure you have the money.",6,"July 27, 2022",3
"The start of this game I think is extremely strong. However, when you've been playing as long as me, which is since Nov 2020, the game gets increasingly boring as u do similar quests or events for a few of the currency to pull characters. I do like this game, it's very polished and has rlly good design overall, no doubt. One thing that ofc needs some improvement is end game. The only end game content is abyss, and that already is quite basic. Enemies are rarely changed in abyss.",22,"August 25, 2022",3

Genshin is my absolute favourite game. The main story line is incredible and even the side stories are impeccable. The graphic is amazing and the sceneries are breathtaking. The quests can be hard but they give you a round of adrenaline. Honestly think Genshin deserves way more appreciation. I was so lucky to find a free game like this. Props to those who made it and waiting for more updates.,4,"August 25, 2022",5

"The game is addictive and very good. The characters are great and the story is amazing. The problem with the game is that materials for leveling your characters are too hard to come by. When you level up in adventure rank the people you fight level up as well. I don't think they should level up from adventure rank, because now I have two heroes leveled up to 70 and my enemies are at 72. It's ridiculous because getting the material was hard, and all of my heroes aren't level 72 because materials.",1,"August 10, 2022",3
So here's the problem. Take it from a gamer. Its not meant for phones. Playing on pc or console its amazing. My only issue with this game is the fact of developer locking character progression and even the characters themselves behind massive money pay walls. This game is great enough not to have to do that. Customizations with character outfits I get. Even weapon customizing with looks. But locking progression and trying to force a games length is terrible. Few other things but this is main one,0,"September 8, 2022",3
This game was extremely fun. Amazing game play beautiful graphics and astonishing story. If you asked me a month ago I would have given this game a 5 star. But the problem is is I broke my phone and when I got it replaced I logged on excited to finally get back to building my characters (I had just gotten xiao) and I found out that all of my progress was deleted. I was so upset because I spent almost 7 months playing,2,"July 19, 2022",3
"Generally ok game. There has been alot of glitches and bugs recently. It's not letting me switch characters, I have to keep tapping and maybe 10 seconds later it finally switches. Then there's another glitch that doesn't let me do any damage but maybe a few seconds later ALL the damage symbols show up and cause a bunch or damage. Same thing happens with healing, puzzles and almost everything in the game. It's getting really annoying and unplayable. Also the graphics tanked... It's blurry/chunky.",69,"July 18, 2022",2

All you need even is internet and an 16 AR.I absolutely love the story line and the fact that ever major character,even side ones as far as I can see have their own stories and backgrounds that I can get to know. Therefore,in my not so humble opinion:This game is the greatest",1,"August 27, 2022",5
I really love this app even tho it crashes a lot in my phone. It has good quality graphics and I really love it. And also why the damage number won't show up whenever I fight with enemies?. I hope they can fix the crashes too. But overall it's a good game.,2,"July 12, 2022",5
"I used to grind genshin alot and it was a good game. I would play it whenever i was bored and played with friends too but recently i had to get my computer shipped so i never got the chance to play (its been a month since ive played) and my whole data and account got wiped and reset. I lost everything, my levels, weapons, characters and storyline got wiped. I was at adventure rank 32 and now its been reset to 1. I later read about the issues and found out that if you dont play, it will get reset",1,"September 1, 2022",2
"Fun game, but its a bit painful if you're free to play let alone putting any less then 10 dollars a month. UPDATE- So the more I play this with friends, the more I notice a flaw this game doesn't seem to really address. There is almost no incentive to play with others. Unless you're being carried though a domain or a event is going on you really have no reason to do so. Maybe a increase in drop rate/amounts with a increase in difficulty for domains when in multi-player would give you a reason..",9,"August 27, 2022",3
"If I could remake this game myself I would, but I'd really only change problems with artifact rng and character obtaining methods. Other than that, I'd probably redesign a boss or two, but that's about it. Maybe there are a few things I'd change otherwise, but I can't really list them right now. Overall pretty good game, chool character designs and stories. Toxic loud minority fanbase (especially on Twitter) but I mean it's Twitter what do you expect.",4,"August 12, 2022",3
"Im really satisfied with all the music background and the graphics, play style and even the settings is great. The only thing that I'm not really happy about the gacha system. I grinded primogems to pull for characters but everytime it's more than 76 pity. However, everything else is pretty much great and I cannot compain about anything.",0,"September 10, 2022",4
"Great game overall. Only Issue is that the quests and events are different than before. More on talking and puzzles, with so many dialogue. Wish they would put a skip button, for hangouts and long dialogues since I do my sister's commission and it has been a problem ever since. Also because there's not really much to do and If I do it's always resin and side quests that's very long.",0,"August 23, 2022",4
"The storyline is stunning just like the views you get to experience , character design and combat animations are amazing! But when it comes to gacha , well , wishing it's absurd how in 6 10 pulls I only got 2 new characters and Amber , the single pulls only give you weapons at this point. I'm also from the EU but because of texture problems (pretty much every where , esp on stormterror) I had to abandon my AR 30 and switch to Asia where the textures work for some reason?",3,"August 24, 2022",3
Its hard finding games like this. I really love the work u guys put into it but story progression is weak and exploring and having op weapons is like a big thing in this game. I feel like im falling beind some games let u pass all of this and enjoy the story which i love but if i have to level up two or three times then I would have more luck playing Assassins Creed Odyssey. I got rid of the game but if u guys change this and add some customization to the orginal character i would install again,0,"August 15, 2022",3
"Enjoyable!... If anyone Has issues playing this game then your phone isn't up to the task when it comes to running it, simply put, buy a new phone or play on lowest graphic settings, the amount of apps you have installed also causes lag so take your phones ram into account. I have a Samsung A23 running on lowest graphic settings (45fps) and no issues other than a random lag due to the games interior information being generated while I'm simultaneously playing it.",14,"July 27, 2022",5
"Amazing game. Although the rewards aren't very good, I love the plot and all the plot twists throughout the story, however I don't like how long it takes to go to places you haven't unlocked for quests, it's really difficult sometimes.",0,"August 25, 2022",4
"It's honestly such a great game overall, from game mechanics, to character design, and lore. But I wish they would add more end-game content! Theres absolutely nothing to do once you clear every quest and 100% your exploration. Overall great experience though.",3,"July 12, 2022",5
"I like this game a lot, is easy to play, the storyline, the graphics, the characters are very cool. Even without spending any money the game is fantastic. The only problem is getting 5 star artifacts and weapons and the fps drop when other people use a burst like the Venti one (even on ps4)",0,"August 19, 2022",5
"Such an exceptional game. They had a whole orchestra for music, amazing scenery, so much detail and effort. Nice story and subevents. They are making it better in every update, usually consider feedbacks BUT as it was stated by many others even if your mobile device is pretty good (mine has 8 gb ram,features are perfect for games) it lags when it comes to stories. AND there is huge damage gap like x6 between paid players and f2p due to constellations and 5 star characters. Farming artifacts hard",6,"August 25, 2022",4
"I played this game all time time on my computer but it died recently so I tried playing it on mobile and it's way too hard with touch controls. A fight that would be no big deal is suddenly much harder and I die a lot. If they add at least controller support (I play with keyboard and mouse usually but can adapt to controller) I'd give this 5 stars as I really do enjoy this game. At the moment though, it's completely unplayable to me.",16,"August 5, 2022",3
"Hadn't the chance to play it, I couldn't download it at once so I had to continue downloading it whenever I had internet, after I got the update from play store, I lost all the download progress and had to start over :/ it was better if the graphic pack was optional or at least let the player download the graphics later on game.",5,"August 28, 2022",3
Ive played this game since it first released and played continuously through each update. The game has the potential to be great but has one huge issue thats plagued it from the start: the lack of skin tone diversity in genshin. The game takes inspiration from so many different cultures and fails to properly represent the people they are taking direct inspiration from. This has grown more apparent with the reveal of sumeru characters. They need to address this problem and be better.,2,"August 22, 2022",2
"Edited this review to reflect my current views of the game. Game is fun, characters are amazing, the visual asthetic of the world is at times breathtaking. Taking all of this in consideration, it does lose some of it's charm late game, but not entirely. Events are frequent and new characters get announced almost every patch.",10,"August 8, 2022",5
"This is a great game. From the graphics and the map, everything is perfect. 1 idea though, I feel like it's kind of ironic that the main character is 1 of the weakest characters in the game. I think it might be interesting if as they explore the nations, they gain more elements they can control (instead of just switching) and becoming more powerful.",157,"July 3, 2022",5
"This is one of the best games I've played so far! Though, my only problem is that the damage numbers don't show up, and it's really annoying especially whenever I try to showcase my characters. I still have to change devices just to see numbers, and it's such a hassle because setting my devices up takes a long time. I don't really mind at most times, although if you can, please find a way to fix this bug!! 💕","1,240","July 13, 2022",5
"I love this game! Lore, characters, graphics and gameplay are absolutely stunning, there's a lot to do and explore and there are new updates very often! There are obviously some meh things like artifacts farming or the pulling thing or the mobile graphics but they are not a big problem. It's a free game and it's super fun to play! Tho I recommend the PC version because it's pretty hard to play on mobile.",53,"July 5, 2022",4
"The game is amzing, the art style got me hooked in from the beginning. The story is complex but also easy at the same time! Tne game could be better by making it online though but my rating is still a 5. It has so many characters and an emense storyline full of action any new players looking for an MMORPG this is the game to start with.",0,"August 13, 2022",5
"A great game that makes me want to invest some time into it, however makes it near impossible to do so due to the energy system (resin). This makes especially less linear farming, such as artifacts, extremely lengthy with very little rewards if you get unlucky. Overall I'd still recommend it however would also make clear that this isn't a game you can easily pick up and get everything quickly (alone due to special 5 stars that appear like twice a year at best). you're okay with grind? go for it.",78,"June 14, 2022",3
"This game is absolutely awsome! I have been playing it for two months now and I must say I became addicted,I love the graphics and the quality and the voice actors but there's something that I would like to be changed, leveling up your adventure rank is quite hard and slow that sometimes I lose hope and the artifacts thingy isn't quite explained during the game so I had to rely on other resources to understand so I would like an explanation from them plus for the leveling up to become easier.",82,"July 12, 2022",5
"Excellent optimization of suck a large game. Great work! Also, the game is amazing, you cannot get bored easily because it constantly gets updated, and every character has cons and pros. The only negative is the wish system, because I have seen a lot of players spending a ton of money just to get some extra wishes to get their favorite character!",0,"August 17, 2022",5
"Absolutely incredible game, the only problem is the amount of space needed. I've had to delete almost all my apps for this game, I am a huge fan of the game and adore playing it. But for mobile players like me it is horrible. The game runs very slowly as well, so for all the data I've given up for it, it's a bit of a let down.",0,"August 29, 2022",4
"The automatic climbing is so annoying. Mid fight when I dash and if there's anything which can be climbed my character stops fighting and starts climbing. It just sticks to the wall and yea the camera omg , in open areas mid fight I just see grass nothing else. It doesn't matter if I turn on or off the combat camera its just worst while fighting. EDIT : ok they really did a good job on graphic optimisation. But the climbing part is still annoying and during battle I only see grass in open field.",23,"August 1, 2022",3
"Game is amazing, main quests, side quests with the scenery is beautiful ... aside from a few minor things such as lack of resin, slightly annoying when you do large tasks for less primogems and the artifact farming can also be tiring but other than that this game is excellent.",2,"July 13, 2022",4
"I love this game sm. Especially the storyline. But there are fews bug/glitch that always happen, especially for players who using cheap device like me. Anything that related with water in genshin, for instance, river and ocean. It always glowing which make me barely see anything. The last one is sometimes I can't see the opponent hp bar, maybe they're glitched. Hope hoyoverse's team can fix this.",0,"September 2, 2022",5
"Beautiful game, both the lands and the characters are visually pleasing, wish there were more darker skinned characters though. There's a lot of stuff you can buy but I've been playing for a few years and am proud to say I haven't spent a dime, even with that I still have so much fun playing and am not opposed to spending in the future.",3,"August 24, 2022",4
"The good: Looks to have a great story with some nice characters. By all accounts, the monetisation isn't too bad either. The bad: the game is an unoptimised mess that took almost two hours from installation to actually being able to play, assuming you can even play it - out of five devices, only two would install it, and only one would then download the whole game. 14 gigabytes is just too big for a mobile game for most users. And the controls are awful too, no autonav or autofight. Play on PC.",19,"August 7, 2022",2
It's a really good game the only problem is the game gets boring the more you play. There are less things to do. For something fun we have to wait for events. It's also kinda hard to get primos ngl. Another thing is sometimes I have to uninstall the game and reinstall the game re-download EVERYTHING just for one update!,2,"August 6, 2022",4
"Been in the gacha game circle for years and was mainly here for that, getting into it by one of my friends who plays more pvp than I do. I can say it's been really fun so far for an open world mobile! It's so much fun to explore and see how the story unfolds for these past years, making memories along the way. Due to not only design and event problems though, it's rough to get the full story by not being pay to play. The grind is tedious if you want to flex, but other than that, its good.",0,"August 24, 2022",3
"Overall great game it's just that for low end phone users we cant see grass,dmg text,and ice on water Other problems such as loading too slowly while opening the game, also loading too slowly on using waypoints, entering domains, teapot etc. Some dialogue scenes glitch and not playing the whole thing, the cutscenes are fine its just those problems:) hopefully u guys can fix thid long time issue",0,"August 25, 2022",4
"I rate it a 4 otherwise I would rate it a five. I rated it a 4 because it can get your phone hit really quick within just 15 minutes of playing, it's a really fun game would totally recommend if your phone won't be destroyed by overheating. Otherwise great game and would love to find more like these !",0,"August 26, 2022",4
"a fun game! though after a while you eventually run out of content to play so the most you can do is do your daily commissions and grind to make your characters better, which can get a bit repetitive, but that is okay! I also love the music and the sound design, it's really cool! but regarding the character design: hoyoverse, don't be afraid to give the characters some melanin.. we have 2 tan characters and the rest is as white as snow, I'm sure you can do better... right?",7,"July 12, 2022",4
"At first when downloading this game it does take a while maybe an hour or 2 but once it does its am easy sign up/ login then the quests are easy to follow it's a fun battle, story, fantasy game that I believe everyone will enjoy there wasn't many bugs and when downloading make sure to have enough storage space it's very VERY important 10/10 game!!",0,"August 24, 2022",5

"The game has been on the decline and recently, they're stuffing events and character storyline with filler that's not fun, only the main archon story quest is what's stopping me from quitting. It's the fact they have characters keep waffling on and on about some random thing and have no action or using their combat system or puzzles not to mention each story takes multiple hours.

"This game is so great! The only thing I can ask for is controller support for android and that would take the experience to a whole other level. Please, Mihoyo!!!! Update: It's been years and still no controller support. iOS has had controller support for a long time now and we have been ignored it seems. I don't see why it hasn't happened yet.",1,"August 13, 2022",3
"Its hands down an awesome game. Story. Graphics. Characters. All 5 stars. But recently there has been a lot of bugs, lags and issues that I just can't play the game like I used to. Fix the bugs! I'd still be happy with lesser events if i could just play the game properly.",8,"August 9, 2022",2
"Fun game if you like exploration. For people like me who doesn't care about game's lore and just want to explore and/or go to action this game is a nightmare as we can't skip endless boring dialogs, it's such a headache honestly. At some point in the game you run out of stuff to do, and there's nothing fun to do, spiral abyss is a joke but the only joke we got left. It's the opposite of usual mmorpg where you have a boring experience until u reach the endgame. The soundtrack is really good.",2,"July 13, 2022",2
"I would say the game is really well done! It has a lack of content for players who girnd the game daily and rush over the main missions, however as a new player the game is really overwhelming. With new regions coming out and more and more characters avalible to play the game really feels more open and free. I do wish for changes in the gacha system but right now its ""okay"". I really hope future updates will intruduce more quality of life changes.",4,"July 22, 2022",5
Such a fun adventure game with a bunch of lore (story) and exploration!! All of the characters designs are beautiful. The only problems are probably that a lot of end game players don't have anything to do like quests and challenging stuff and the wish system and artifact domains are very RNG.,4,"July 14, 2022",4
"As a casual, I've spent lots of free time into the game and I love it. The only gripe that I have with the game is that there's controller support for iOS..... but not android. I use only android and now that I don't have my pc really makes it hard to play effectively (although this is a personal thing). Please, Mihoyo.... add controller support for the android!!",2,"August 24, 2022",5
I began playing a couple of days after launch. While I enjoy the lore and the characters there are a myriad of technical improvements that should be made. I don't think controller support should be something exclusive to iPhone users. I think Hoyoverse at the very least owes its android users an answer. I would probably play far more if I could use a controller.,4,"August 24, 2022",3
"Overall this game is amazing. Can't believe that this game is for free, the graphics, charcters, fighting style and the world in Genshin Impact would rate them 1000/10. The best game I have ever played, best experience and best in game music I have ever heard. The music is so relaxing and enjoyable. Really love the graphics, charcter designs and how every character is different from the other. Would highly highly recommend to play this game for everyone especially anime watchers. 10/10",5,"September 6, 2022",5
I love this game and I would rate it a 5 star but I've had a problem with a few things. the archon quest in which we fight tartaglia(heart of glaze) when I reached the last part I've had my screen turn dim and I couldn't touch anything and I still cannot complete the quest!!! This is very annoying and since I can't complete thta quest I can't even unlock the domain.

"This game got me hooked. Sad to say though, I no longer have it on my phone because 64gb phone isn't enough for this. But still I can't get over and I'm giving them a 5-star review. I love the characters, their gameplay, their stories, the design, overall aesthetics, and most of all the good music. If you're ok doing commissions and farming stuff to build your team well (even if most are RNG), I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this. Also, thank you for being the only game with Albedo, Diluc, and Venti.",1,"August 24, 2022",5
"Be ready to get addicted to an open world adventure game. Full of multiple quest along with an interesting story line.

I also have a suggestion for the 2nd anniversary: maybe one free 5* character, 30 wishes for event exclusive characters (event wish banner), and new pair of wings because I like the one's from last year! Please do so that other apps that aren't associated with hoyoverse don't get review bombed because of another anniversary prob like last year. Like Googleclassroom",0,"September 8, 2022",4
It's the perfect game that I was looking for. I wanted to try something new something different and it is my first rpg game. It has massive and gorgeous map with awesome characters and well written storyline. Overall I wanted a game that I could play for long time and not just play it for a week and then uninstall it. It gives pc like experience on phone. However the gacha aspect and it's fandom ugh..,289,"August 24, 2022",5
"One of the most inspiring rpg ever created. The right amount of adventure, lore, battle system and importance of characters' personalities all tied in a beautifully crafted game.

"It's a great game and it was worth the get but it took me 17 hours for it to load and it kinda takes a while to load my lvl and stuff, tho it is a awesome game and am thinking of giving it a five star & like I said before took me 17-20 hours to load. There's 24 hours in a day-anyway besides that it's not bad I love it still but could you fix a few stuff.of and there's a whole lot of bugs I found in there being not able to pick up stuff having to leave the game and go back in that stuff gotta fix",0,"August 18, 2022",4

"The game is overall great- the graphics are amazing, the designs are stunning and the story is very intriguing. Although, Hoyoverse really need to learn to be more generous with the in-game rewards, such as story quest rewards and particular world quests. Also, Inazuman chests are trash because you need to defeat 4 or 5 samurai just to get to open a simple common chest which you can randomly find in Monstadt and Liyue. Please work on that!!",2,"September 7, 2022",5
Love this game but just lately it keeps crashing on my phone and making it utterly unplayable. I can't even get passed the white loading screen before it crashes and closes.

"The game is fun, but once you get so far in the game and need upgrade materials, your are doing a lot of waiting either 3 days a week and some material you only get a chance once a week and a lot of characters need that for certain attack upgrades. That makes me start loosing my interest in playing.",1,"August 21, 2022",2
"Awesome game potential, horrible implementation, the character designs, world building, puzzles, lore and everything around these lines is so great but the gameplay us awful. Open world gets stale really fast, oculi are a chore that needs hours to be completed, using resin and doing comissions takes too much time. Added difficulty everywhere using time limit instead of making the enemies actually challenging. Plus the free rewards and rates as a gacha are terrible.",8,"September 8, 2022",1
"That is what I expect from a game the graphics , gameplay, characters are all a sight for sore eyes.

"Genshin Impact is really a great game. I have had my fair share of fun times playing it. The story is top notch. Gameplay is good and smooth. Ingame rewards are underwhelming. Progression is horrible. Always money hungry. Hard to upgrade without paying, I don't want to pay for upgrades after buying a character. I became a regular spender but don't feel like continuing after realizing how horrible this system is. Will play for story & cutscenes only. I hope they fix these things.",62,"August 14, 2022",1
"This is a fun game with great graphics and even better lore and characters, but my only annoyance is with the gacha system. Its much different than other games gacha systems and in a bad way. To even get one 5 star character you want, you have to actually spend money which is very annoying. And even then you might not even get the 5 star you want. F2P beware!",0,"August 19, 2022",3
"Great game! Although its a bit hard, sometimes lag and could fix the awkward view angle since every battle it keeps on auto adjusting to weird angles and make the battles harder since it needs to be adjusted again. But overall its a very good game! 5 Stars!!",0,"August 24, 2022",5
"Everything would be fine if there wouldn't be Android users biscrimination.

Well the would've been fun if it wasnt for the one of the worst mechanics ever in video game if you throw an enemy off a cliff or if they accidentally fall down or you get out of their reach for a couple of seconds or at times when you manage to outrun the enemies for a while thr game simply respawn the emeny with full health and some of them take like 1000 hits to go down and can literally one shot you and the game simply reset the enemy when they're about to kill them after 10 mins of combat,3,"September 11, 2022",1
"The best game I DON'T recommend. Very grindy & expects a lot of your time for little payout, even if you spend money. Just read the wiki and manga instead. The world is beautiful, the story & general gameplay are okay, but it takes about a month to build one character and the entire game is designed around making you spend as much of your time as possible on it without giving you much for your effort. Spending money helps you get characters but it doesn't get you better items or equipment.",50,"August 15, 2022",2

"Great game, just a little too much work when you need to find some things in the events. Not giving enough primogems either for free to play players.

And what the best thing I like in this game is player can't distrub you world like take the treasure, kill the boss without permission.🤣 And the bad thing I don't like in this game is, no mount..just can walk, run using stamina, climb, fly and using teleport. The map not small, really huge map. Mine still beginners lol.. and why no daily reward in game..🥺",0,"August 18, 2022",4

Tho I miss how I played kn the beginning, the quests and stuff when you're ar 45+ everything is just a repeat, do your dailies and spend your resin. Ofc you still have side quests you can do but they're boring. All that said I'm looking forward to sumuru and I'll see how that is😊",1,"August 22, 2022",4
This game is absolutely amazing. This game can be a little addicting but overall its a pretty fun game. One thing there is not much for the endgame players. The game is great for the new and upcoming players. The storyline the animations the characters are all perfect. This game is not pay to win. You can be a Free to play and still thrive in this game. If u put ur time and effort into it. This game is still going on in terms of storyline. So thats pretty exciting to look out for.,0,"August 14, 2022",5
"This game is cool and all, but for a beginner it's kinda difficult to get used to, and it's hard to get characters. I have also failed a few too many times at the flying/gliding test thing T^T. Alr so I loaded it up after around a month of not playing it (Took an hour to load+update) then I got onto the game and all my progress was gone. I was back at the start. What happened?",14,"September 6, 2022",1
"I love the game to the point that I even bought a new phone to have a better experience hahaha. Tho, I have heard a lot of complaints about the first anniversary rewards is kind of cheap. This is my first anniv. with genshin so I hope it will be memorable. Furthermore, the lore, the gameplay, the characters and all are amazing!💙🥰",0,"August 20, 2022",5
"By far the best F2P game I've played in years. I joined at launch and played non stop for over a year. However, this game can be grindy and can burn you out. I havent missed any events, but havent felt the need to 100% everything anymore as some things can become quite boring or repetitive. Can't wait for Sumeru!",0,"August 23, 2022",5
"Absolutely love the in game atmosphere and music, the lore is very interesting too. The pacing of events are just fine for me because i play it casually. Graphics are superb, especially the character animations that look fluid and smooth.",0,"August 14, 2022",5
"love the new update, but now i cant even play without the app crashing. Not even five seconds into entering the game, it immediately crashes. Now the game is quite literally unplayable for me. Ive tried deleting apps and useless files but it was still fruitless. Hope hoyoverse could do something about this.",0,"September 11, 2022",2
The game is too op but the problem is it's censor system in chats it's just trash it even censors the things that are not meant to And i would suggest a system where you can like send a gift to a friend like PRIMOS or some ascension items or artifacts... And a skip dialogue / cutscenes option would be great too.. Over all the lore and character storyis great Also pls introduce new hot male characters...,3,"August 24, 2022",5
Good but it's a bit slow and has a bit too much grinding needs alot of attention if I could change it somehow it would definitely be adding a dodge function controller support and letting me do more things for exp and primos like let me do everything more than just once a day that way I can just spend like 2 hours one day grinding instead of wasting more than 3 days on it getting frustrated and sometimes just not having the time and being unable to do the story quest at all due to account rank,0,"September 9, 2022",4
"Really good game, graphics, story everything is great!. The only thing that bothers me is that if you want to change your server u have to start from the beginning. Idk if its possible to transfer your data into the new server but if it is.. Could you do that? Many people want that too. :)",21,"August 24, 2022",5
"Fantastic overall. The music is phenomenal, and the art style is gorgeous. I have played this game since launch, and honestly there is no gacha game that comes close when it comes to the amount of fun that can be had in this game. I have met many friends along the way as well. There are many improvements needed for this game though. Like for example at least one end game permanent continous event. The rewards could even be small. Keep teasing next patch characters that has been great too. Thanks",25,"August 20, 2022",4
"I love the story of the game. I love Lisa in there, sole reason I'm playing is because of her. But one negative point: I am struggling like of some people to make this game work on an Android 13 when it can work. Whether I set the graphics high/low, it doesn't work and the game lags. Anyway, I love the game. Thanks for the masterpiece.",0,"September 5, 2022",5
"I rally like this gane, but i can't even olay because the game is constantly lagging and reconnecting to severs, this is incredibly annoying. And really not worth all the things i deleted and space it took up on my phone. Im so close to uninstalling this gane because it's is so annoying not being able to play without crashes.",0,"September 6, 2022",3
Even though it takes much time to get primogems I honestly love the game and It 'still so enjoyable. I sadly want to rate it 4 star cause it takes too much storage. I wish I could delete some quests that I have done and without a fan the game lags too much.,0,"August 20, 2022",4
"I've grown addicted to the game and I absolutely love the characters but one of my main problems with the games is the artifact farming, I have to spend at most 5 condensed resin a day, only to have everything go to defense or hp. I hope you guys improve the chances of getting good artifacts or increase the resin limit so that we don't have to constantly waste our resin.",0,"August 16, 2022",4
"This has been my favourite game since the release, the storyline and lore is very interesting. The only problem is that once all the story quests, hangouts, events, abyss and exploration are all done and you have no resin it gets quite boring and repetitive. good game tho :D also please let us pet the animals i am begging",1,"August 24, 2022",4
"The game is fine overall, there are nice characters and the world is very complex, though there are some issues. It is too time consuming trying to get good artifacts, new characters and generally doing long quests or puzzles. Also, the variety in the characters' skin tones is concerning. There's absolutely no representation of dark skinned people, even the ones' supposed to be dark skinned are pale and that should be talked about more.",48,"August 18, 2022",1
"Although the game is far from perfect, like the resin and artifact systems, and amount of daily commitment, it's still one of my favorites for a few reasons: - Despite being a gacha game, every character can be built to perform well. - Captivating world design and extensive soundtrack. - Lots of in game lore (in story quests, readable books, weapon and character and artifact descriptions, and NPC dialogue) - Elaborate combat system and party system, assigning an element and unique set of skills.",0,"August 24, 2022",5
The game is amazing but it has grossed over 4 billion dollars...Its about time we get SEVERAL new enemy types please? This would really make the game much more interesting to play through or at least gives us something new to be excited about seeing and fighting.,0,"September 10, 2022",4
"I LOVE this game so much. I honestly haven't played any kind of game in years, and I decided to download Genshin Impact because of the ads I kept seeing on Instagram. Everything about it from the music to the scenery is spectacular. Playing Genshin, particularly focusing on the story love, has helped with my anxiety attacks so much. It reminds me so much of Zelda, which I played when I was younger. The open-world flexibility is the absolute best. Thank you so for this beautiful game! 💗",12,"August 23, 2022",5
"It's not new player friendly. I'm a long time player (since 1.0) and noticed how events are region/main story/character story locked. The events are not available for new players. Even for players that have been in hiatus and trying to come back, it's unforgiving. Most of the time it causes them to just dropped the game completely. There's a high chance you won't understand a lot of things because important lores are event exclusive, hidden or plain translated weirdly.",120,"August 24, 2022",2
"Seems pretty cool. I didn't get that far after getting Amber as a character before it lagged and blacked out my screen. Speaker was going crazy too trying to play the music. Only reason I was able to exit was because my wife called me. Hope it gets fixed but for me, it's an uninstall",0,"August 16, 2022",3
"Cool. Some performance issues here and there but it plays well. Wish there was a settings menu in game to adjust controls as well, the movement ""stick"" being in a set location doesn't feel good.",0,"August 17, 2022",5
"The game has been very upsetting the past few weeks. Because every time that i try to load up the game it gets past the first loading screen but when i open the door to enter the game it crashes. I've tried everthing i can think of to fix this problem and to no avail, every time i boot up the game i analyze the files and it always says that some are missing. I let the files update and despite saying the files are fine it still kicks me from the game and says some are missing when i boot back up.",32,"August 19, 2022",2
"an absolutly wonderful game, 100% would recommend. although, if you are playing on mobile, beware of glitches! other then that, this game has an amazing story, plot and wonderful graphics, music and sceanery. the characters are amazing too.",0,"August 13, 2022",5
"Tbh the game kinda sucks on mobile but that is because the medium doesn't give the game justice. Do yourself a favor and play it on pc. I love almost everything about the game. The English VA is awesome, the visuals are astounding, the OSTs are mesmerising there is lore everywhere, the stories are touching, epic, funny and well written, almost all the characters are interesting in their way and all have their personality. The gameplay/theorycraft and optimization are deeper than it appears.",1,"August 13, 2022",5
"I have been seeing a couple of problems in genshin as a Mobile player. Even though my phone can handle the game pretty well, being a 6GB RAM phone, there's still some issues i face, firstly, the lack of servers: meaning if you don't live near a certain server, your ping would always be atleast 100 and that's really not helping at all. The second thing: I can't see ice, grass, and damage text, maybe it's my phone, but I'd like your answer. I support you guys and your work, please fix these issues",6,"August 18, 2022",1
So recently I changed my phone into a 8 + 3 ram and I played this game since I expect that 8 + 3 ram is enough performance to play the game with no lag problem. After downloading the files and play it somehow the graphics are terrible the fps is very low when I completed the tutorial I checked the graphics setting and if I apply 60 fps it says that it's too much when. When I try it it's very laggy eventho I make it medium but the fps is 60 still,0,"August 24, 2022",3
"The game is pretty addictive. The main problem is that being an F2P will be hard as it will take a long time for you to get charecters and eventually level them up. But the game makes sure that you do not face problem on being an F2P, giving us options to decrease difficulty and also time enough to develop our charecters. The graphics, sound and story is awesome. I am an F2P myself but i love this game.",0,"August 24, 2022",5
It's always lags on mobile and can stop completely. But other than the fact that the low-key white wash the characters it's a good game and fun to play alone and with others. I hope that in the future they make more inclusive characters with darker skins.,0,"August 26, 2022",3
"love love love this game, the characters, the lore, the scenery are everything! however new content takes too much time to be released and sometimes new content/puzzles (such as in 2.8 GAA) are too difficult to solve that i gave up and stopped playing for several days 😴",0,"August 24, 2022",5
"pretty incredible game given the huge content which is completely free. Huge, zelda Botw-like, world to explore. gacha is not great, but you can do absolutely everything even with free characters, with the exception of the abyss dungeons which require more investment, which is the only real endgame content of the game currently. I strongly discourage people playing this on mobile though. open world exploration and combat is far more suited for pc or console.",0,"August 24, 2022",5
"Its a fun game to play but when you get to adventure rank 50 and above, theres a lack of things to do unless there are events. Ive completed every quest in the game(exept for one or two that are locked behind commisions) and have gotten everywhere 100% exploration exept sumeru which came out on the day im writing this.

But here a problem, it just too much storage and I can't download other app. Why can't you company try fix less storage. For example, 10GB, 9GB or less storage. So, please fix the less storages so I can download other app.",6,"August 23, 2022",1
"Hmm, it has a time problem. It is unsatisfactory how you can stay stuck. Being unable to see any real content for such a long few days. But it's addictingly good... free to play... it's consequential. For sure really don't get stuck trying to play the game free to play. It will be good, but like the Ying to yang it 'will' take your time. But at least you may enjoy it. I guess. *Shrug* idk, depending on who you are.",0,"August 24, 2022",3
"Designs are beautiful, music is chef's kiss, characters have such great personality and lovable. Its very hard to not get attached to this game, for its lore and story is top tier. The games adds a new twist on open world games and draws inspirations from other games while not being too ""copied"". Amazing how it's a free game, of course there is the option of paying money for in game currency, however these currencies are given by simply putting in effort to grind in the game.",0,"August 28, 2022",5
"LOVE THIS GAME... HOWEVER... The game develops know what issues need to be fixed. The same issues that have been in the game before Inazuma was even a concept (on top of New issues regarding character models). The game is good at telling a story and there's nothing wrong with that however, I play this because it's a game. It hurts when those main elements of a game are lacking and it'll only get worse from here. I just really hope COGNOSPHERE fixes many (or all) of these issues in 3.0 (Sumeru).",4,"July 27, 2022",3
"This game is just awesome. It is worth of getting 4 stars, But It needs 8 to 16 GB ram for high and medium quality graphics. My phone is 4GB ram, And i cannot afford 8 or 16 GB ram mobile.

"An amazing game with amazing graphics and combat, aswell with great enemies and amazing lore. Only reason I gave 4 stars is because it's just to pay-to-win, like most gotcha games, but the rewards given to the community are less and less when you start getting into the higher AR's, please hoyoverse, give us some more serotonin and stop making us run off copium. (Changed it to 4-stars because three does not seem right)",2,"August 23, 2022",4
"I think that the combat is to easy, there should be an option to activate hardcore combat that is a bit like Sekirot:An stand endurance that can be broken (which stuns you) by being attacked or blocking at the false time. Realystic damage for you and the enemy like being dead after 5 hits but same for the enemy (of curse big enemies and bosses tank more, like 15-35 for big and 50-150 for bosses), way weaker regeneration and so on. So that,, pro player'' get a REAL CHALLENGE FOR WAY BETTER LOT.",0,"August 21, 2022",4

"THIS IS NOT A MOBILE PHONE FRIENDLY GAME 👌 it lags a lot even if im at my ultra lowest settings, the storage capacity is so large that you need a seperate dedicated phone with only this game installed to be able to play it semi-smoothly. updates are so large that some mobile users are forced to replace phones that have larger RAM and storage just to keep up.. if you're a mobile player-only like me, i recommend to use an ultra high-end phone just to keep up at least until their natlan release.",15,"September 8, 2022",1

Random crashes are occouring in game. Edit. Be wary of this game progression you have to dump money even in stamina (resin) if you wanna progress at anything but a snail's pace. I'm taking about taking more than MONTH to build a character to level 80. also can't play for more than 20 minutes without hitting resin wall. And this makes abyss which gives a pitiable amount of primogems impossible.,1,"August 24, 2022",3
"I think the game is a good game to play, especially if you love gacha games and anime games (like me). The one thing is genshin takes time and you have to grind stuff every day, which is pretty fun but it gets boring after a while (for me at least) when doing that over and over. I do like the fact that you can hang out with your friends in a world and do domains with Eachother. I feel like new updates always get the hype for genshin impact back for me.",0,"August 20, 2022",4
"Amazing love the grafics the characters in the game are stinning the lore is also very nice really recommend if you like the type of adventure game, what I love the most is that it's a open world explore!

The characters are beautiful, the story so far is not bad, graphics are nice. The amount of storage this game takes, which is 15Gb, is too much, given that it requires internet connection to run, and I don't like the gacha mechanic, because I don't have billions of money to spend on fictional characters, but sure, it's a nice game. UPD: The story is cringy, but ok",0,"August 24, 2022",4
It's a good game I'm not going to say it's the best game ever made because I'm still a rookie 😂 Here are a few things to know. The download is quick but you will have to register and the wait after will test you patience but once it's done collecting data the game is beautiful 😍 there are some parts you may have to legit search up on YouTube bc they're hard to do. The last is when you're swimming you only get so much time before they drown 😕,0,"August 14, 2022",5
"I start by stating my bias towards an opposed experience against my personal gameplay experience. It is a game for sure with many of the addictive qualities people have come to enjoy in this genre. However, my key issues with the game, as of late, involve the player progression experience not being addressed, the excessive random elements in the game, and, of course, their questionable character design decisions. I could write a literary essay about my concers but these are the primary of them.",23,"August 24, 2022",1
"This is a 5 star game for me, and one of my favorite games period. With a beautiful world to explore, a fascinating story, and so many very well written characters to meet, it's been such a fun year of playing. It can get a little grind-y, and there isn't a ton of endgame content yet. Aside from that it's honestly a great experience if you don't mind investing a little time. Well, more than a little. Super recommend!",0,"August 24, 2022",5
Amazing game! Its a great game for people who like the more adventure kind of aspect in games as well as fight aspects. Its got amazing graphics too! The only thing I'd like to see personally is a more diverse range of characters,0,"August 31, 2022",5
"More diversity. I have been playing this game for almost 2 years and I love it with my whole heart, but the main issue I have with it is that there isn't much skin diversity. I really thought this game would be more inclusive since it's really popular and adds variety of cultures. But when it comes to skin tone we only see tons of white skin and only two characters that are slightly tanned and are not that dark. I was hopeful that you would add more characters with darker skin tone, but nope.",2,"August 23, 2022",2
Look I love the game and it runs great on my pocofone but the game is just way too big at this point. Like dude I don't have any room anymore. Maybe if there was an in game option (cause a lot of phones don't allow this without root) to allocate all the data onto an sd card then it would be amazing. 20 gigs is just ridiculous imo. Please make data and obb location to SD card a thing. you don't allow this game on shadow pc and I can't play this game anymore because of these two issues,4,"September 9, 2022",1
"There's not much to complain about with Genshin. I've been playing for almost a year now and continue to be impressed on a regular basis. People mention lack of ""endgame content"", but I prefer quality over quantity, and the quality of this game is superior to most games I've played - the visuals, lore, music, and overall attention to detail are all amazing. Very well thought out and consistently excellent. I'm definitely a fan and not embarrassed to admit it. Keep up the good work!",0,"August 18, 2022",5
"This game sets the bar in mobile gaming. A huge open-world game that you can play anywhere. This also proves that players prefer games that don't have an auto mode. It feels more rewarding to see your characters grow from the result of your hard work and grinding. The story is interesting. Characters' design are unique. The graphics look amazing. Gameplay, voice acting & soundtrack are all great. Features like climbing & gliding also adds quality as well. U: Just lacking on the anniv rewards",4,"August 24, 2022",4

With amazing graphics and smooth gameplay (well, only if you have a good device), gorgeous landscapes, lore actually worth reading on, and paired alongside absolutely phenomenal music, the gameplay experience is unparalleled. The combat system is fun, as well. However, it still has its flaws, like it's character designs, especially for Sumeru's characters and skimpy rewards. Overall still a great game worth giving a try.",8,"September 6, 2022",4
"Overall this game is really fun to use!the storyline, characters,plot etc. is very good...My phone is vivo y20i and it's very good at gaming from codm to crk and pjsekai, ml their game works very fine with phone and it runs very smoothly but when I'm at genshin it always kicks me, I tried timing it and it took me about 9minites before I got kicked out again I also noticed that my graphics aren't working I noticed lately that I didn't have grass,ice and I can't see my dmg:( still giving a 4* tho",0,"August 13, 2022",3
"pls fix the entire game, every now and then for some reason the game doesnt start and it leaves me on white screen, and when that happens i end up redownloading everything which is extremely annoying and time consuming, if u cant fix the resin, artifact and rng system then atleast fix the starting screen",1,"August 20, 2022",3
"I love the graphics, very realistic. Battling with enemies and completing quests is very fun. Though I have a recommendation for the game makers: Come up with a way to trade characters that one doesn't like/want for level up materials",9,"August 23, 2022",4
"Genshin Impact is a fantastic game. It has its issues, with lack of endgame being chief among them, but the game is my favorite that I've ever played. That includes 30 to 60 dollar AAA games, and even The Witcher 3. Even if you never spend a dollar on it, you will have a great time. Highly recommend.",0,"August 24, 2022",5
"This game is really fun to play with, but I'm having some problems every time I use a burst using my 5 star character my opponent's HP always disappear and I can't play some quest cause It won't start it's just black screen and sounds but I've already start the quest for almost 30 minutes it still won't start how can will I be able finish the quest if it won't start?? Please fix it😭😭",0,"August 14, 2022",4
"I'm just gonna get straight to the point. I freaking love this game. The playstyle, models, and even the lore is just chefs kiss. But I do have one problem. Diversity. If you are going to have an area based on a middle eastern country, then why are the characters so pale? It doesn't hurt anyone to put in a little melanin on some characters. But other than that, great game 10/10.",0,"August 23, 2022",5
"So far, I'm loving the game! The storyline and graphics are great, as well as the monsters and characters. Edit: I still love the game but Ihave a few problems, the level cap is too low, it gets really boring the moment you 100% the exploration and the resin cap is too low, these are my problems atm. There's nothing for you to do once you basically reach Ar 60 and 100% all locations except for the daily commissions, all you gotta really depend now is the events, I do hope chests respawn",23,"August 14, 2022",4
"The game is great if you enjoy exploring gorgeous areas and story content. Even if the managers of the game need to become better at their jobs, they do loyally deliver content every couple weeks - which is quite admirable.",5,"August 29, 2022",3
"Amazing open-world game. Though, you should pace yourself, because there is not much to do at high adventure ranks aside from making characters stronger, talents, etc etc. Needs to be more storage-friendly.",1,"September 7, 2022",5
"great game, but it's not mobile friendly especially for those who uses low/mid end mobile phones and it takes a lot of storages, please add more graphics option like rendering distance, etc. so that they can play with smoother experience",0,"August 21, 2022",4
"It's so fun to support the game for a year and then being f***** up by the anniversary rewards being extremely bad. I'm Disappointed and disgusted at how badly they treat their fanbase. The game has great aesthetics, great story, great characters... But the fact that they treat us like this makes me disappointed.",0,"September 8, 2022",5
"I am playing this game since it was released the game size is large but i face no problem playing this in low end phone(4 gb ram,64gb rom), ofcourse i can't play it in best graphics but in low graphics as well i enjoy game, it is a premium game no other game I've played like this, it is totally free to play no ads,no bugs,no gliches, story is amazing ❤️❤️",0,"August 15, 2022",5
"I've been playing since launch and spent a consequent amount of money in the game. A few weeks ago my account has been hacked and sold, and Hoyoverse won't give it back to me even though I have solid proof that the account is mine (purchase receipts, precise information about the account...). I filled the form to retrieve a stolen account, provided all the necessary information, the proof, and my application got rejected. I am extremely disappointed in the customer service.",8,"September 7, 2022",1
"Please optimize the game for both new processors and old processors (3 or 4 years ago), players need fluidity in the game no matter if the device is old or new. And also, add more ressin to the game, i mean, the ressin ends, the play ends too. And also, the way to get artifacts is annoyance. Remove the stats by number and just keep the percentages.",30,"August 20, 2022",1
"Graphics for high-end device is so cool, the lighting from the lamps are beautiful, the stories are great and awesome, and the characters designs are so wonderful and the movement is great. keep improving this game",0,"August 23, 2022",5
I love this game and mihoyo. I'm so hype when 1.2 was started especially the f2p event consideration. Minus 2 stars because before 1.1 medium graphics set up with 30fps is so smooth af with Nova 5t 980kirin processor but after 1.2 so disappointing it keeps fps drop and even I change it to low graphic setup its still laggy. Please notice on this and make an optimization patch.,3,"August 23, 2022",4
"The game is phenomenal! I really like the graphics and the character design. Not pnly that but the stories that you tell give me great appreciation to the writers of the game. Not only that but also the customer service are so helplful. Thank you for this game Hoyoverse, may you continue to make this game more great than it is.",5,"August 23, 2022",5
"This game is pretty much the one other get compared to and sets the standards. Great story, visuals, playstyle, music and battles. Only downside is slow recharge and amount of resin for collecting rewards.",0,"August 15, 2022",5
"It is a nice game, I've been playing for a year but in the latest update Everytime I go in sumeru the game crashes. My friends also experiencing this problem. I hope you can fix it soon because I can't do the new events.",3,"September 8, 2022",1
Literally unplayable on mobile. The particle effects lag my device so hard that it takes me an hour to do the amount of gameplay that I usually get done in 10 minutes on console. Even the menus frequently fail due to probable memory leaks.,4,"September 6, 2022",1
"The game has a large world, which is fun to explore, and new areas are added almost every update. New characters tend to be underwhelming, but may receive indirect buffs over time. Their simplistic kit remains boring though. There are a lot of clunckyness and QoL issues, that have existed since release. This makes combat an unoptimal experience. The endgame is lackluster. It consists of a small daily loop that uses FOMO to keep you playing. New Sumeru update is good and has the best story yet.",19,"September 9, 2022",4
"even if you didn't gave me yoimiya, this is still the best game ever. the music, the animation, and literally every part of the game is beautiful (except when you lose 50/50) can't wait for sumeru T^T I'm so excited cause it's so beautiful and it's the place that i've been dreaming about since i was a kid and always wanted to go to. thank you for fulfilling that dream 🥲🥲❤️❤️",0,"August 13, 2022",5
The game is great when you can actually play it. It either crashes before i can start playing or on mobile devices it always says insufficient storage no matter how much space i make for it and how many times I reset it.,0,"August 21, 2022",2
"After meeting some friends and doing some reading, my experience has really improved. •The story is okay. •A lot of detail goes into each character's lore, which I personally like. •Aside from Paimon, the English voice acting is really well done and there are recognizable names. It loses a star due to how money hungry the game is, but it's to be expected. If you can sort your in-game priorities, it's not too hard to save. But you'll unfortunately be passing by a lot of opportunities.",8,"August 24, 2022",4
"amazing graphics, story, and fun characters to play! though it is hard to play the game if you dont put money into it, and i dont reccoment interacting with other players off the game, but other than that its a great game!",0,"September 10, 2022",4
"One of the best Open world RPG game out there for mobiles i bet you wont get disappointed for playing this as it comes with good story to boot with awesome graphics and music as well with anime style graphics design. Well some ppls might not like the anime style design but most does, and i do love it too.",2,"August 17, 2022",5
"My phone is over heating. Also there are many bugs and lags in new map (sumeru) and other maps also. I got to say that, when chatting with someone, my keypad gets down without my permission 🥲... Plz look after these things for us moblie users too. Because we don't have keyboard. But still, at the end , I would still give u a full star from me. Thanks for this game. Also, plz look after this game in making more interesting because, I have completed all main quests... I want more.",18,"September 1, 2022",5
"The game is good.. but only if you haven't ambition because the RnG system is super ridiculous and the devs don't want to change anything. I stuck with some artifacts for months though I have some good 4* pieces I can't ascent them into 5* because there's no such function. My time is going to nowhere everyday, every week and even every month since I got only trash artifacts with the same repetitive domain. Boring. The most successful cross platform game is just a bait to sell you pixels for NR.",37,"September 10, 2022",1
"This is the best game I have experienced for a long time, the extensive world is really beautiful and the story line is captivating and entertaining. Although there are in-app purchases it is still fairly easy to get powerful characters and do good damage without spending money.",3,"August 24, 2022",5
"I really like the game but, I always crash in cutscene. Right now I'm a ar lvl 35 stuck because of the always lagging cutscene. It's not my device, don't doubt the newst phone s22 galaxy ultra not working on this game. And I have reinstall it 3 times. Might as well delete this game sooner or later.",0,"September 8, 2022",3
"Awesome, I've played many F2P over the years, I was introduced by my son who plays, it's addictive. Best thing is, u don't need to put money in, tbf, the only thing Money buys is skin, and priogems. And u get them in game for doing stuff. It's long winded, and there is a lot to learn. Spend your wishes wisely, take time to learn things. Once u hit adventure rank 16, it's open world time, people can help you! Things get way more interesting. PC has a version and it's cross play mobile to pc.",0,"August 20, 2022",5
"I have been playing this game for a bit over a year and these major updates don't disappoint, far from it. I am looking forward to more quests and more characters although I feel as if this game is so expandable that the story won't finish for another 2 years. Nonetheless, I look forward to seeing the game in the finished story and playing through the story start to finish.",1,"August 24, 2022",5
I love the art style and the open world exploration. I've had this game for about a yr or so and it is by far one of my top favorite games. I've recommended a few friends to play this game and a lot of them absolutely love it. It's good if you wanna play solo or play with others from around the world or in your region. It's a great way to make friends too. Highly recommend this game if you love open world games mixed with a lil bit of combat!,0,"August 24, 2022",5
I've been playing Genshin impact since it released on PlayStation and it's a beautiful game. I highly recommend it to anyone. It's got a little something for everyone ranging from sword fighting to magic powers to cooking food and even fishing. It's an incredible game with a great story and breathtaking art (think Zelda breath of the wild) with plenty of quests to do and they don't don't really push a pay to play or pay to win agenda in my opinion. Give it a try if you're bored one day.,2,"August 9, 2022",5
"Ok, the game was fun when I first played it. It was fun exploring, but now theres nothing to do late game at all. Plus the game is very problematic with its character design, they refuse to represent darker skinned people, and they refuse to add diversity in other areas as well. It basically makes all of the characters look the same, and it gets boring. Sumeru, which is based off of south asia/africa, has maybe 2 characters that aren't paper white. I used to love this game, but now...",29,"August 26, 2022",2
I gotta tell ya your game is kinda boring once you've done every quest and open all chest around the map 😢 pls make your game fun to play again I still can't remember why I was so in with this game when I first start playing it but now I don't remember. I'm AR56 I'm so close to 60 I dunno what to do if I'm finally AR 60. if I start a new account its just tiring listening to the same voice and things they talk about. I give it a 5star cause it was fun playing it. It was the best game I've played,1,"August 24, 2022",5
"Overall,the game is awesome but the problem is that we low end Mobiles user don't have the some features in the game such as grass,ice damage, and bug with dvalin,La Signora,Yun jin and Raiden's shield. The lag is awful and it has to be fixed ASAP.",0,"September 10, 2022",1
"Lost 50/50 3 times in a row at around 70-80 pulls. Won the fourth one at 45 when I wanted to actually LOSE for once. Lost the next one AGAIN at 80. Yeah, not spending on this garbage. Don't get me wrong, the game is beautiful, the soundtracks are nice, the characters and their backstories / info is well done, the bosses are mostly fair for all ARs, BUT the RNG is garbage. Whether it be artifacts or wishes, it's just ridiculously unfair for an F2P player.",24,"July 13, 2022",2
Its an amazing game with thousands of things to do (not exadgurating) and there are countless places to explore in the entire world and every character has a story to tell. My only problem is today 12 Aug 2022 it just keeps closing the app saying tjere is a big and i need to update it once the developer fixes the bug,0,"August 12, 2022",5
"I really like the 2.4 update. 10 out of 10 for putting Shenhe's mysterious backstory to the release of Enkanomiya. The background music of Enkanomiya and the music when you're in battle, I am really into it. It became more exciting and at the same time, mysterious and magical.",0,"August 21, 2022",5
"I absolutely love this game the storyline and graphics are amazing, so is the art but one thing that's bugging me is the fact that it isn't on Xbox so I can only on my phone. If u can add genshin Impact on to Xbox that would be great",0,"August 17, 2022",5
"Genshin Impact is very amazing. I thought my quality would be very low but turns out the opposite! Once you adjust to all the buttons, you probably, just maybe, get a little addicted.",1,"August 20, 2022",5
"i've never really been into games of any kind. But genshin really knew how to pull me in! The environmental details are amazing even at the lowest graphics. background music is AMAZING and brings out the best of your experience! it makes fights more exciting, exploration more calming, and it just draws you in in general. The character designs are all cool! I don't think I'll be quitting this game anytime soon. play this game if you can, you won't regret it!",32,"July 8, 2022",5
"It's okay a little overrated. Graphics are nice if you use a PC instead of a phone because then you have to lower graphics to play the game smoothly without lag. It may just be my phone or the internet connection I have or both. Another thing I don't like is how you have to install another app to get daily rewards. I don't play the game except to redeem them, not really all that fun tbh. But that's my experience I'm sure many others would beg to differ but it's meh.",5,"August 25, 2022",2
"I LOVE THIS GAME!! The gameplay is addicting, especially the elemental combos you can pull off! More than that though is the LORE! From the deep, rich, grandios lore for the world and gods to the smaller, more manageable, but equally cool character stories you unlock by befriending the characters you use alot! everything is so wildly interesting and I love it! Also you can win without paying, I never paid a dime!",1,"September 2, 2022",5
"I love the game, but may I suggest adding a Skip button so you could skip the dialogue, I love the lore but sometimes I want to skip through the dialogue and it takes a long time to do it manually, a Skip button would help a lot. Other than that this game is fun.",1,"August 24, 2022",4
"I changed my review because of the recent changes. I'm glad that they taking fixes on graphical issues in OPPO devices especially my curent phone. As well as their taking step up in the games which the sumeru update make me overjoyed on the quality of it. Still it's sad to say i can't fully experience it with graphical issues like no grass, no dmg text, no ice bridge and etc. Thanks Hoyoverse for improvement and waiting it for more fixes. That's the only i want for them to improve.",1,"August 30, 2022",4
"2nd review. After the recent update (ver 3.0), the game become way more laggy, and starts to stutter constantly which ruins my experience in the game. Before the update, the i have no issue with the performance so I'm assumed the issue have something to do with the latest 3.0 patch. Hope the developers will do something about this.",8,"August 24, 2022",3
"The game itself is teriffic and amazing,I would highly recommend but there is one major problem which is that at high adventure rank there is basically half an hour of content each day and thats it,also the developers need to buff some characters like for example Diluc and keqing,the new characters out shine them by far but like me people like to have fun with different characters which is currently very difficult as old characters are hardly viable anymore.",0,"August 24, 2022",4
"Amazing story and great amount of effort put into graphics, lore, music, fighting and puzzle mechanics. It's well optimized and loads fast on phone. I removed a star hopefully temporarily. Latest update is breathtaking, inspired by India/Arabia. Most characters have a very light skintone despite foreign names. It's very disturbing, changing a colour on a model is easy. I implore you to re-chose appropriate skintones, even for playable characters (eg. kusanali). It comes across as discriminatory.",8,"August 27, 2022",4
"Genshin Impact is a delightful feast that grows every year. Outstanding soundtrack, smooth combat, and beautiful visuals. Mobile version runs very good and is crossplay. Every year a major elementa area is released. Throughout the year, events, enemies, music, characters, weapons, and more are released.",12,"September 4, 2022",5
"This is such a very cool game! The music is epic and so are the sceneries! The fighting style is so good, and the voice lines too. It's abit laggy since the Sumeru Release with the large GB and stuff, so it's not recommended for potato phones. Maybe making the storage smaller? But overall, I LOVE this game. Please keep up the good work!",2,"August 26, 2022",5
"I love this game- really, I do. The story is great- the animation for big scenes are absolutely beautiful. I mean seriously- this game has great graphics. But there are big issues in this game that others have criticized time and time again that Hoyoverse simply has not acknowledged seriously. The diversity issue- especially with the new Sumeru update! Artifact system as well has been a huge complaint, and difficulty has been a huge issue in inazuma. Good game- hoyoverse just won't listen.",0,"August 24, 2022",3

"Beautiful game and very fun to play. Building comps with different characters is satisfying. Gacha aspect can be a bit daunting and you won't get every character you want unless you plan for it, but still manageable. Anniversary rewards were okay after they listened to some of the feedback. Looking forward to future updates.",1,"August 27, 2022",5
"3.0: sumeru was great the art, music, good as always, but the archon quest was a disappointment, to much nonsense, and repeating the same thing over and over was a waste of time and annoyin, I also thought that when sumeru comes out the resin cap will increase but it didn't, and that is really bad now that we have 2 talent materials added, and 2 artifacts added, and weapon materials, and 2 bosses, do you think players can upgrade a character with only 160, and please balance the game, buff diluc",29,"August 28, 2022",3
"I tried on multiple occasions to get into this game, it failed every single time to suck me in. Weather it be its story or just open world environments it's failed to grab me. The art work is amazing the graphics amazing that's all it really has going for it for me personally. The combat is too slow compared to other similar games out there now these days ToF for example is much better combat IMO and feels way more rewarding to explore in ToF than genshin. Overrated in my opinion.",3,"August 25, 2022",2
"This game is really amazing! The graphics are really high quality and the characters, lore, and gameplay are flawless! Only 1 problem that I have; it takes up WAYYY too much space on my device!

"Everything about this game is amazing! From graphics, characters, storylines, you name it! You can see that the devs worked hard by the little details they've placed. Although the game is great, I just have one tiny problem. The updates. I'm thankful for the updates the devs release but everytime I play the game I gotta wait for the update to be downloaded so that means more waiting time.

But it's a whole new experience for a newbie like me in the world of 3PRPG .",0,"August 23, 2022",5
The game is all good. It also exceeded my expectations in certain areas such as map size and small details. The only problem is lag issues. In India the ping is too high which hinders the performance. I have been playing on Asia server. If this is fixed the quality will definitely improve,0,"August 24, 2022",4

"Its a good game with lots of puzzles and adventure very addicting game but there's things that make me upset like 1.power creeping: its a problem not most people care about but for some people there favorite character will slowly be unusable in the coming months and new characters will thrive in the meta, making people uninterested in playing. 2.not listening to the community: hoyovers is known to not listen to the players especially with character bugs fix or character buffs they never listen.",2,"August 25, 2022",3

So there just isn't enough diversity in the game",17,"August 25, 2022",3

The game is amazing the graphics the characters the quests& the story are all very entertaining& the game is quite addicting however to level up characters you need a lot of materials that most of the time are very hard to get also the artifacts are extremely difficult to obtain& to clear the domains to get them you have to work very hard& often they aren't good artifacts or they ones we want so it can be very stressful so if they could make it easier it would make the game more enjoyable,0,"August 24, 2022",4

I've turned it down to one star because I'm sick of the blatant whitewashing and lack of black representation. fix it.",223,"August 26, 2022",1
"This game is absolutely phenomenal. From the graphics to the story and characters every thing is just amazingly put together. It is definitely worthy of a five star rating, however once you get near end game there's less to do, but even still you should be able to find someway to entertain yourself whether it be with friends or just alone.

"It's a really good game. The creativity and everything is spot on. Fun to play with friends, family, or just alone. The only issue is the lack or responsibility twards skin tones.

"So uhm i'm a pc and mobile player who is ar 57 and have invested a lot of time in this game. The scenery is incredible and the world is very pretty. The combat is pretty fun where you mix different elements to get different elementsl reactions. My only gripe an an endgame player is that there isn't an endgame. Once you reach a certain point all you do is log in, do your dailies, then log out. Theres nothing else to do, and im saying this with 100% exploration. My advice is take the game slowly.",47,"September 3, 2022",4

I'm sure hoyoverse can work something out. my 128GB phone can't take it no more, much less those with 64GB😭 had to delete the game a few times already bc of storage problems",1,"August 26, 2022",3
"Great game. Great soundtrack , good graphic and visual scenery. Scheduled event at its finest. New story quest, side quest and new character. Decent reward for the player but still acceptable. Grinding stuff is fun for beginner but kind of harsh later in the game. The character and weapon collection gacha are systematic but a little bit expensive , rng equipment artifact that is kind of irrelevant, rng material drop that is fair but kind of lacking. Btw the sumeru 3.0 patch is awesome",38,"August 24, 2022",5
"This game is amazing i love the character designs, the storyline it is one of the best games I have ever played though it takes alot of storage it is worth it! If you are planning to download it and don't mind to lose a few apps and photos then do it as soon as possible!",2,"August 23, 2022",5
"Wow! The game is very amazing! The graphics so fabulous! I love the game very much! I suggest this game to my friends and family! My phone very not lagging while playing! My phone really can withstand the ultra high graphics! I love the story, the music is the most bestest! I would like to travel with Paimon in real life! I hope Paimon can be playable character.",0,"September 2, 2022",5
"Mondstadt and Liyue are great introductions to the game, with newer areas Inuzuma and Sumeru gives us a more challenging experience. Not to mention the music is what enhance this game to another level, for each region have it's own unique musical style and tone Aesthetically the world building and characters are astonishing, both serve well for the theme of the ""open world experience"" additionally each character have it's own individual speciality which just makes the experience more enjoyable",1,"September 2, 2022",5
"It's a great game, though it took 4 hours to finish loading when I first got it. I'm not exaggerating.. it took four whole hours, once it finished the voice acting was rather glitchy, and it was just super laggy, but after the first part it was alright!",0,"August 29, 2022",3
"i am now considered a veteran player to the fanbase sitting at ar 56. this game is no longer enjoyable. i found myself at a distaste for the lack of model variety. the game and characters are still very well done. but there's a major lack of communication between the company and players. playing the game is like doing homework for school, there's characters who are extremely similar it's funny. a lack of diversity for something that's based off the real world with real cultures and religions.",0,"August 24, 2022",3
"Nice graphic and story, but it has bad multiplayer system if this game supposed to be single player game then the balance of the enemies is not balance and the grinding aspect in this game is too much to handle and in order to complete spiral abyss player need nice artifact which is take long time to get 1 and its really really time consuming and not worth to presue or play this game and the other thing is player need some certain character to enjoy playing story like op shield buff and stuff.",0,"August 29, 2022",2

"I absolutely love this game I have been playing since it came out and im very pleased with it. The game is constantly coming out with new characters and adding more parts to the huge world! I love the story that you experience as well. This game has lots to offer from characters, teams, builds and more. ^^",0,"August 23, 2022",5
This the best game I have ever played.The best thing about this game is that it has mind-blowing level graphics and music.But for in lower budget devices you won't be happy with the performance.That is the main issue you can't play this game in lower budget devices but I am sure that if you ever play this game you will get addicted. Overall this game is best.,0,"August 29, 2022",4
"Fantastic good fun for almost 2 years now! A beautiful immersive world, surprisingly complex and rewarding combat, and every single character you get to play is awesome. 👉 DO NOT become addicted / obsessed with gambling real life money trying to get a specific character. PATIENCE AND GAMEPLAY is all you need!!! Support the developers, because they're doing an amazing job. But you can do that with a couple $$ - not a couple hundred $$. Peace ✌️",0,"September 1, 2022",4
"How to Make Genshin 5 Stars 1. Double all primogem sources (daily commissions, quests, chests, achievements) except for events 2. Add more teleporters or give the player a magical creature to ride for faster travel 3. Add offline LAN mode + cloud save upload so players can play genshin offline 4. An option to have unnessesary dialog (such as the story) be automatically skipped 5. Less characters that use thier abilities then are swapped off asap 6. Changing META 7. More puzzles in the open world",5,"September 1, 2022",3
"This game is really good but takes up a lot of storage and once downloaded grows from around 100mb to 9 gb. Edit: Now from around 7 months later it grows from 700mb to 13gb. For mobile players, graphics can be poor. Rewards in game are low and it makes the game harder to play for free to play players. Edit. Once you start playing it can be very addicting and compared to other games the characters are well designed just be wary on how much you spend",6,"August 24, 2022",3
"Missions may be hard, primogems may be hard to get and to earn, but at the end is all worth it, this game is worth playing for eternity, the new characters trailers make it 100% more exciting.

"PLEASE MAKE CUSTOM HUD/BUTTON SETTING!!!!!......... It's very needed to mobile player,, in Sumeru Map you may use the special feature to make your move easy, but sometime its will very useless because that button will disturbing you when you want to swipe the screen at war with monsters,, that matters also make crash move(low dps) because the button doesn't in the right position you want. Please tell me if you was made the custom setting, I will back to give 5 stars and install to enjoy again!",14,"September 2, 2022",1
"I've played this game for a while and finding more and more problem about this game. Most annoying of them all is the combat, instead of having fun with the elemental reactions I first thought when I saw the game, the combat feels more like a chore and rank up quest is a nightmare and it's mandatory as you have to progress to go explore the other map.This makes my game experience ruined as what I like the most is the exploring and solving puzzles part.Also 5 star character rates are abyssmal.",7,"August 25, 2022",3
"I really like this game. I played it on console and found it on the app store. But there is one problem. Whenever I load in, after a few minutes, the game freezes up and I have to restart the game. It doesn't ever work for more then 2 minutes before it completely freezes up. Can someone help me find the problem? I did file verification, it said to repair, still doesn't work.",2,"August 16, 2022",3
"Besides all the problematic character designs, which is ,indeed, a serious matter, I would like to add the fact that the quests are so time consuming for no reason.

"Pretty good game, and it's definitely no longer the BOTW clone it used to be. I do wish it was easier to get primogems though. Most players can't even do one pull per day, and that's quite absurd knowing that it costs 160 primogems for ONE pull and you get only 60 a day mostly. For a gacha game, it definitely lacks an F2P friendly gacha system. But, it still has good graphics, catching storyline, and overall great exploration. (P.S. make it so resin regenerates faster)",2,"September 4, 2022",4
"No endgame content. World is nice, but super long wait times between content updates means it gets stale kinda quick. Coop needs improvements - can't even craft items at the alchemy table. Still missing a lot of quality of life improvements, one of the more important ones being able to use condensed resin on 40 resin cost bosses.",5,"August 29, 2022",4
"Been playing since a month after it launched. Love it! The lore, the characters, the music, and the scenery! It's amazing! Great game where your only problem would be resin and mora sometimes XD totally recommend!",1,"August 23, 2022",5
"Been playing since version 1.1, easily one of my favorite games. It can be a little janky, and there's too much grinding for how much resin we get in a day. But with the new QOL update coming with 3.0, and if a couple more get added, I'm sure that'll be much less of an issue.",0,"August 24, 2022",4
"I had quite a lot of fun. Then I hit somewhere around 4 minutes and 17 seconds of gameplay and immediately headed out. You see, there's no controller support on Android.

"okay, it used to be a 1-star review and I probably should have waited until anniversary, but man genshin has been so good recently. we've been getting fire updates for 4 patches straight, starting from irodori fest up to sumeru, the quests were interesting, the rewards were satisfying and the overall quality of the game has significantly improved. it made me fall in love with the game once again. good job, hoyoverse.",11,"September 3, 2022",4
"This game is aesthetically beautiful, combat system is nice (combo with different elements). Love the exploration of the world. The problem is lack of communication. Since they reach 1B they stop communicating to the community. They refuse to release/make a balance patch or tweak.",7,"August 30, 2022",4

"It's great :) I've been playing thus game ever since it got out. Probably September 2020??? I've had so much memories in this game, it gave me so much friends. But ever since the start of 2022, I lost interest in the game. It was maybe because it would give me the worst artifacts which made me waste all my time. I came back to this game this August and saw how much of my friends quit the game and that some of them reached ar 60. That was my dream too, to reach ar 60, I lost interest in the story",0,"August 29, 2022",4
I've played all mmorpg games..and this one has the best battle system and storyline. My only problem is that I'm not particularly a fan of anime and childish graphics. Maybe the developers could develop a realistic graphics fantasy or medieval theme type like genshin impact battle system and open world. I'd play it forever. This one i like it but they're too childish haha,0,"August 31, 2022",5
"OK Genshin, it's almost that time of the year again. If you can't even give the bare minimum of a free standard banner 5 star character you deserve whatever wrath comes your way. It's not even a good gift for most of the player base. However it's amazing for people like me with 40+ 5 stars who have yet to get their favorite character and the perfect way to bring in new players.",22,"September 4, 2022",1
"Love the game! The story line, graphics, character and many more things but the only down side is the game takes a lot of storage and you need a good phone to play it on my phone this game alone is taking 17 GB!!!! It's a lot and i hope you try to reduce the amount of storage occupied by game Thanks.",1,"August 26, 2022",4
"It's a good game with amazing characters, but I got bored of it quickly. It's sort of repetitive in a way, where everyday it feels like you're on a task to do the same things you've been doing over and over again. I think it would be more enjoyable if you actually pay attention and get into the storyline. Decent game 👍",1,"August 23, 2022",3
"This game is nice but it's not new player friendly because of all the event thing. It's a story driven game and not having the chance to participate to an event will robbed you of some pieces of the lore. Also being a solo player because I don't want to play with other players it's hard, there some quest you need to achieve only when you play co-op. At least let's us have some options to download/participate in past events. The game is good though,that's why I want to able play it the way I want",4,"August 24, 2022",1
"okay so, i've been playing this game for a long while now (512 days according to hoyolab). it was one of the games that i thought i would never get bored of, since i was playing constantly on a daily for the first 11 months or so. turns out the repetitive gameplay and the daily grind for as little as 60 primos does get boring after a while. i still love this game a lot, and do suggest it to pretty much all my friends, i just wish there were more to do.",2,"August 24, 2022",5
"This game is peaceful and absolutely beautiful, but I would really enjoy it more if it was on Xbox. I only have this game on my phone and I just love the game, but my storage can't handle the updates. I don't get how you could have this largely developed game on a phone but not on an Xbox that can take the storage of the game better than a phone.

"Hello once again Genshin Devs!! First of all, thank you for the latest fruity lore content you brought us this version. The new nation is so surprising and also the new characters. All new stuffs are too awesome. Also thank you for the optimization that you have made for Android platforms... It really helped a lot to explore the map with less lags and screen stutters.

"I want to love this game, and I have for the past two years, but now? It's unplayable. Lag on mobile is to a point where I can't even do my daily commissions. I was so excited to explore sumeru but I can barely even take two steps in without the game performing at the same speed of a lame badger. I just want a switch port",23,"August 26, 2022",1
"The game is very fun, many things to explore, quests or lore, i enjoy it a lot. Since a new nation has come out there's a lot of new places for early players to explore and get more rewards from there's new things to achieve and new characters to meet and try out In total it is a very fun game it takes some time to understand game mechanics but it's all worth it. people are complaining about pronouncing issues in Sumeru but said we're overreacting when we said so elsewhere. sometimes laggy tho",1,"August 29, 2022",4
"Everything is great about this game just you will wait a while depending on wifi and your phones storage before playing and besides the random audio cracking, the game is pretty good but I recommend getting the PC or Ps4/Ps5 version if you want a smooth experience but if you don't have a PC or Ps4/Ps5 this it the best alternative.",0,"August 24, 2022",5
I've been playing this game for nearly a year now. It has been a really fun experience and I really like it.Sadly a big problem for me is that there are barely any actually dark skinned charakters.

"the side quest in sumeru definitely deserve a praise because it doesn't hv the sme pattern like side quest in other region and it actually not annoying. The puzzles are good and creative, plus the npc's designs in sumeru are beautiful. The only thing i disappointed is there's barely comic relief in the archon quest. The plot twist when we have to choose number 4 only, nilou dance and tighnari sassy attitude are the only part i found amusing.",261,"August 27, 2022",4

Love it despite being hard. It can be p2p and f2p depending on which you would like but being a f2p might need a lot of time of grinding and waiting but don't make that as a hindrance to play the game. I dare you its fun and exploring new characters and areas give joys and lore is very great and exciting although cliff hanging sometimes.,0,"August 24, 2022",5
"A small review, because I can only write 500 words. Graphics: They are great. Story: Is good, but Sumeru feels like it's dragging on and most characters are uninteresting. Weapons: I almost don't have a chance to get copies, same goes for the characters. Artifacts: It's still the same issue, I can't get good artifacts. Leveling a character is easy, same goes for Talent. World: First when I start playing, it wasn't so great, but with the Sumeru update, the world feels like its somewhat alive.",5,"August 27, 2022",3

This game is amazing and when my sis told me about it I just didn't install but decided to give it a chance and after 5 minutes it was super fun and entertained me more than enough. Imagine that the traveler has to leave teyvat but is stopped by the archons who try to convince them to stay. And he walks down in the loading screen to get to Khanriah. Then they got their powers back and defeated the unknown God and got her powers and had a choice to become evil or good.,1,"August 24, 2022",5

"After downloading genshin on my phone, it lags in the way of any time I hit an enemy, it literally deducts no life from them. No matter what move or who I use. I literally cannot fight in the domains because I will always lose due to this.

Rn the app is just taking up space on my phone that I could use for a useful game.",10,"August 31, 2022",1
The best open world rpg out of everything! I like the storyline and characters design and it have so much content to play.

It's okay if you wanna play it but be wary of the gacha it can suck you dry like a succubus. Also Hoyoverse still gotta fix somethings like resin and the artifact system. At high level it's just too boring to play the game as new characters need atleast decent artifacts to reach potential but the same are rng based and require resin to get which limits how much farming can be done for them. So you reach a stage where you want to play new characters but it's too much work. Other than that it's ok,19,"August 30, 2022",4
"This is a great game to play. I like the open world expected and the Story line, I also like that we can create our own world inside the teacup which it's really cool , I like some of the characters way of fighting and the characters design. Things I think that the game creator should add to the game is more dark skin characters and I also think that they should focus more on putting voices everytime the characters talk cause sometimes they don't do that and it cam get a little bit exhausting .",1,"September 4, 2022",5

I love this game so much but there is only 1 problem this is my first time playing and I realy liked it but after some time my game was loading in perfectly and crashes in the first few seconds..not saying that its only this game i have full internet conection but its happening to all my games I hope this gets fixed soon idk what is happening.Other than that I DEFINITLY recomed getting this game all the features and its beautiful vibrent colors I would give it a five stars if it can get fixed.,0,"September 10, 2022",4
"As an AR 57,Game is fun, especially the lore that keeps me going.I would give 5 stars if you fix these problems. Firstly, the wishing system, 160primogems for one wish? when you only get 60 per day from daily commission if you are an ar 57 and above player. Please make a change for more accumulation of primogems daily. Next, the condensed resin limitations. Only 5 condensed resin are allowed in your storage. It's really not enough for end game players, who mostly use it and not normal resin.",3,"September 9, 2022",4
"The game itself, storyline, character personalities, gameplay, everything is really good. However, the game def needs more diversity. As someone who studies history, it's kinda upsetting to see characters based off of real life people who have dark skin, such as Kandake, made as light as me, a white person. Representation is not something Genshin should have a problem with, as they did perfectly fine with other characters like Yunjin. Not sure what happened with the Sumeru characters :/",0,"August 24, 2022",3
"After expierencing Tower of Fantasy, Genshin has started to feel sluggish in its movement controls comparatively, the new element only reacts with the already power elements, leaving anemo and geo to its own playstyle, and no level cap increase so the game is still pretty stale in gameplay HOWEVER the New sumeru area is absolutely beautiful and well designed so far, the story feels relatively adult and not quite so harsh as the inasuma line and is very much worth the look Game needs more game",0,"August 25, 2022",4
"Believe me, It's an amazing game. All the problems that people are telling in their reviews are the problems that are caused due to their devices, internet services, etc. This game has almost no technical bugs/problems. You can play it as a completely free to play game, though if you decide to spend on it then obviously it's gonna make the game easier/convenient for you. And obviously if you are playing it as a free to play then you have to grind a lot. That's what a gacha game is after all.",0,"August 19, 2022",5
"This is a very good game to play a lot of interesting storyline/lore, great characters, great visuals, great voice acting (recommend Chinese VoiceLines) and many more! I've been playing for over a year now and I still have not stopped playing it's addictive. It's a f2p game but there are options for goldfishing and whaling I personally am a goldfish lol but back to the topic great game but there are 2 half's of the fandom the one you wanna avoid and the awesome part of the fandom :)",0,"August 9, 2022",5
The game is really fun overall but the amount of storage taken up from my phone is really bad. I hope hoyoverse knows that most of their players are mobile players and do something about it. Another is the lack of diversity and skin color the characters have.,9,"August 24, 2022",3
"I really do love this game, the thing is that the game is pretty hard to improve in, which in my eyes is good, but if you don't like to work hard keep in mind that this is not one of the games where you get everything easily, the game itself is beautiful and interesting with a lot of quests and beautiful creatures, I personally recommend this game very much.",0,"August 24, 2022",5
"Still boring after the Sumeru Update. The Sumeru Archon Quest is utter garbage with no exciting fighting gameplay experience. Dialogue goes for hours and hours and only less than a minute of actual gameplay experience. I play the game, of course, only for the reason that this is the only game of its kind. But I want the developers to be more creative about the gameplay aspect of the game.",5,"September 7, 2022",2
"This game is SO ADDICTING and the gameplay is so fun, the map is large and there are lots of things to do in this game, I wish they would give better rewards for leveling up your Adventure Rank, giving only 3 NORMAL wishes on AR 60 is dumb, I play the game SO much to get to the max level and only get 3 wishes? Insane. Still I adore this game so of course gonna give it 5 stars.",0,"September 6, 2022",5
"Story is decent, characters are great, music is amazing, exploration is fun, events great! 5 star rates are bad, artifacts farm is RNG hell, current end game content is lacking. I suggest you play through the first two regions (Monstadt, Liyue) before deciding whether to keep playing.",415,"August 17, 2022",4
"It's a very good game to play if you're bored at home, or if you just want to kill time, and or just enjoy the story and characters. Downside is if you finish the story quests/game there's nothing really left to do, except do some commissions. And the commission's is kinda repitetive and thats what makes is kinda boring. Overall very good game!",270,"July 7, 2022",5
"Any BOTW fan can tell how solid of a game Genshin Impact is, truly a gem of a game. Everything's great gameplay wise, but on mobile there are some performance issues, one that bothers me the most is how hot the device gets in 60FPS mode, if hoyoverse can fix that, it would be so awesome, but a game of this caliber on mobile is awesome already. And also, I wish there was a SEA server so we could have lower ping.",0,"September 11, 2022",3
"VERY FUN! I like the sound effects, the realistic music and real life interactions. It makes me feel more free and gives me the chance to discover a whole new world without moving. Highly recommended, it gets pretty boring if the game is getting stale cause of no update and you're in the middle of a banner you don't like. But other than that, great game, though I would really want it if they improve the co-op system. That way it's easier to meet other people and hang out with others.",90,"July 11, 2022",5

"I love this game. The story, characters, character designs, music(very good!) are the best! There are problems like artifact farming which is repetetive and becomes boring after a lot of times, bugs(just report it and they will fix it and give compensations). Also there are a lot of interesting events and the developers are generous in giving primogems(not much in late game though)",106,"July 13, 2022",5
"Far too much investment into the game to be worth your time. However, my biggest complaint has just been semi-fixed with the new artifact strong boxes. Giving mihoyo a 2 star for actually addressing the issue after what took them a year to finally change.",3,"August 24, 2022",2
Too much puzzles on the montage events. Had to logout check YouTube then go back to the game to clear 2 character montages. But when I got to Mona. I had enough. Ended up playing Diablo Immortal instead. No puzzles. A very disappointing event.,0,"August 22, 2022",3
"Currently only the app (800mb) can be moved to an SD card while the data (17gb) cant be, which is the stuff it installs one you're in the app. If there could be a way in-game to move the data to an SD that would be greatly appreciated because my phone barely has any storage left.",0,"September 4, 2022",3
"I'm a mobile player. Before the new update my graphic can go highest but mostly i use lower graphic and it's working very smooth and just fine. But since the new update it start lagging and glitch, i also got kicked out from the game. I hope you can fix this because it's so hard to play. If this continues i don't feel enjoy to play and and i gotta delete the game by force.",1,"August 10, 2022",3
"Since new update today, all I get is force closing after I press BEGIN screen. Cleared cache and did repair 2 times, said it was fine. I'm not Uninstalling and reinstalling a 15gb game because of this. Will change my review when fixed. Never ever had a problem before with this game. Disappointing",76,"September 8, 2022",5
"Bro I'm telling yall this game is perfect! It has graphics that are out of thus world and rarely feels like a game I installed on my phone. Edit: OK so as a game it's amazing, but the diversity is lacking I still think it's nice to play and fun but I do think they should atleast try and fix their poor designs.",0,"August 25, 2022",5

This game does not seem to like me. It says every 10 WISHES IM SUPPOSED TO GET A 4 STAR OR HIGHER...BUT I get nothing and I have been saving and wishing for the past 2 months witch still gives me nothing. The past 2 months I was able to make almost 18 wishes. I used them all and only got a 3 star and below. Last on some of the quests I can't do co-op mode unless I finish them witch are hard ( I'm only on adventure rank 45) and I am weak because some of my characters can only acend when inazuma..,0,"August 13, 2022",3
"Honestly a beautiful game, cool to see many different cultures and their practices through this game. Unique characters(my personal favorite is Raiden Shogun) and free-roam. A huge map and many areas to explore and still growing. And beautiful scenery. Love this game. Keep working hard Mihoyo and thank you to the voice actors. Amazing so far. 💜 Edit: Disappointed that the Sumeru characters are mostly light skinned. Isn't it based off of India? Very disappointing Mihoyo.",1,"August 25, 2022",5

Yes, there is no endgame content, yes, the artifactinf and wishing system could be better, but you fall in love with the amazing story line, graphics, characters, and so much more.

"incredible game, been playing for over a year and im still hooked. i only have 2 issues with the game. 1) storage size - game soze almost doubles with every major update, soon, mobile players will be left behind and a lot of people will be unable to continue the game. 2) the misrepresentation SWANA cultures in sumeru, and the lack of representation in a game that is meant to display a world with several diverse cultures, yet only has light skinned and lightly tan characters. do better.",157,"August 23, 2022",4
This app is amazing. It's full of fun quests and has an amazing storyline. It has a bunch of characters to choose from.

"Really fun game. It has a neat story, Breath of the Wild style exploration, and fun combat mechanics. It's also a gacha game, and comes with the usual pitfalls. The rewards you get from quests and events in this game are worse than any other gacha game I've played. This means a lot of grind, especially for late-game players. I'm also not sure why the android version doesn't have controller support, playing on mobile without that is miserable.",7,"August 23, 2022",4
"It's really unfortunate, I really was interested in playing the game, but I only put one star because I wasn't able to get it to play. I downloaded it on my Lenovo Chromebook with lots of free space(I practically emptied everything for this game regardless)and yet it would load for literally hours but never start. I tried it three times, I tried downloading it on a different device, I tried using a different wifi source but it never works, it just drains my battery. :/",6,"September 2, 2022",1

The graphics are stunning, the new character releases are fun, exploration is wonderful. The fighting is unbalanced, the puzzles are awful and migraine-inducing, and don't make me mention when you actually mix them TOGETHER. The lightning on the islands are horrible. Makes a calm person rage-quit like no tomorrow. Please fix this game...",1,"August 28, 2022",2

"This is an amazing game with great lore and graphics. However, the farming systems is horrible (such as artifacts) it is lack of many basic things that will bring no harm to developer but could greatly help the player such as skip buttons for story quest, more end game events, increasing condense capacity to 50 and create an rare item such as daily commission skip card so that busy people can play another time and make coop useful. Character design is showing too much skin.",11,"August 20, 2022",4
"This game is normally a 10/10, 5* review quality game bc the open world is amazing, combat is perfect, character designs are good. BUT recently the game has been plagued by disgustingly incessant time consuming puzzles. Its a sad way to create ""more"" content. Your just wasting everyone's time now and we are not willing to pay anymore bc of puzzles, these need to be non mandatory.

"Hello! Im here to express my worries and compliments to the game. I've been obsessed with this game ever since i started playing it. Characters are good, Story lines, Events etc., but i hope genshin could be quite flexible in low fps laptops or phones. As a mobile user, it's kind of hard to keep up with my co-op team. Both open world and specially when we do domains. Mostly i use a healer but i can't stack up energy because of slow appearance of enemies. But overall, my experience was super fun.",2,"August 9, 2022",5
I love this game. The music is top notch. The graphics are beautiful and the character designs have a different uniqueness to each of them. The fact that you can play with your friends online is what adds to the game. Each main quest and side quest all have lore and are important to know more about the game. The game makes you want to keep going and learn more about the world of teyvat and the new imcoming continents.,100,"July 1, 2022",5

The reason this game is getting a 1 star review is the account management. I spent 3 hours trying to login to my ps5. There IS NOWHERE to login. You have to make a new account.

"While genshin is a good game, its wish/pity system is infuriating. I play for hours on end and grind for primos, and even buy primos out of desperate attempt to get characters i want, only to get hundreds of trash weapons i will never use. The only times i have gotten anything good is when i stop playing for months, and when i get back i get sometuing rare. At the very least, it would be nice to get more primos from missions and commissions. I would honestly not recommend.",96,"August 30, 2022",2
"Gonna switch to Tower of Fantasy even I spent thousands of dollars here. Genshin is getting so boring. Multiplayer is dull and serenitea pot is a big mistake.

"I love this game and have been playing since the start, but the amount of space that this game is taking up is starting to get ridiculous. Just on mobile it's taking up 20+GB and on ps4 each uptade takes around maybe 15-20 GB. It doesn't sound like much but it builds up and if you have other games too then you're gonna run out of space soon.

Ok I absolutely love this game yet there still if a few minor issues. The main one for me would be that since I play on mobile it may be like this for everything but when fighting the screen like moved so i can't see what I'm doing and I have to put it back the other problem would be that for mobile only I think it keeps lagging and crashing and yes I do know nearly every mobile player has this issue and the storage but for the storage I think it's worth it this game is amazing :D,2,"July 30, 2022",4

"It's a really good game and it has a amazing story, the only things I wish changed is that it take a lot of storage and if your a mobile player it take a long time to load. I also wish that they came out with more 4 star characters rather than 5 star cause there's about 50 characters and most are 5*. When your F2P its extremely difficult to get the characters you want, if it was easier to get a character like lower the amount of wishes you have to make to get a 5* it would make the game more fun",1,"July 13, 2022",4
I have been playing genshin impact since the first day they released. And had fun and enjoyed. But now it's really dissapointed playing after new updated and version released.

"Its a great open world game, with stunning graphics and easy mechanics. The only problem is farming and spiral abyss. Farming will costs you a lot of time since it limited by resin and if you are in end game, you don't have a lot of fragile resin left. As for spiral abyss as long as you got a 2 well build dps on both team should be able to smash floor 11-3. Farming artifacts is pain, rng never changed, and they will never make artifact farming better.",1,"July 13, 2022",3
"Nice game, could greatly use some optimization and fair prices on in app purchases. Also lessening the pity system would be great too, so you know, It could be more user friendly and new gamer friendly. EDIT: The game's pity system sucks by a rating of 2/10, as there are lucky accounts. I have only 5 characters that are 5 stars despute my friends having 9 or more 5 stars on their roster. The pity system or the RNG needs to be fixed. False advertisement of the high probability on banners.",4,"September 9, 2022",1
"A great game and started playing since 1.0, however, playing Genshin now feels like a chore. The anniversary rewards are disappointing. Most of the content are tedious and the amount time spent is not well-compensated. There are games out there that give better and more generous rewards.",4,"August 24, 2022",4

This is the only game that ill probable play for 20 years if it continues that long... I absolutely adore this game... Im mainly interested in the lore and the characters... This game is so detailed that even every npc have their own story to tell... I absolutely love this game... But the one thing that this game lacks is end game contents... When you reach high ar there is nothing much to do than farming and waiting for stories...,0,"August 21, 2022",4
"In my point of view the game is awesome! But there is a problem, the problem is at the start then you first open the game, since I had bad Wi-Fi it took me 3 day to actually get into the game, and what I'm trying to say is please think about the people who have bad Wi-Fi and make the loading screen a bit shorter please?",0,"August 21, 2022",4
"Literally the best game ever. I would love to spend my time for years just to see the end of its story. Must be interesting when Hoyoverse make us to create a theory for every story, no. Every detail in the games. I love to see everyone theory about how genshin will end, or How complicated some clan, or why Venti's statue had ""Gate to celestia"" on the bottom of it.",1,"August 25, 2022",5
"The games been too friendly with me so far, been pulling 5 star characters here and there, storyline is good and interesting as well, the gacaha system is not bad at all, although it can be quite frustrating at times when levelling up your desired characters, the games free roam adventure vive really sets me off to play it even more and more, the Graphics and Fps are also super smooth that its almost like playing in heaven, good job Hoyoverse 🌹",0,"August 5, 2022",5
"I'm writing this review on my computer but anyways Genshin Impact is an amazing game, it's multiplayer, there's a ton of different characters, and overall an amazing game, but it takes up a bunch of space, it takes a long time to get priogems (used to get characters and weapons), and it takes a while to level up to get to use multiplayer. But still it is an amazing game and i'd recommend",6,"July 25, 2022",5
"As I've been playing this game for a year, absolute best experience for me! I could say I'm addicted. But as time goes on, things gets what they weren't used to be. But that still doesn't stop me from having fun with the new update! And I rate this a 4 as it over-heats my phone but it's not really a problem for I only play 2-3 hours and the solution is just to be in a cold place but overall, 4.8 if I could, 0.2- points for not giving me heizou yet",1,"July 25, 2022",4
"The game is phenomenal. So much to do and so much to look at. The story is so good and the characters are all so lovely and interesting. The only bad thing is that it takes up a lotta storage so be wary of your space. Also the gacha system can get infuriating and addicting so that's something to watch out for. Overall, 5/5 stars. Cannot recommend enough",3,"July 13, 2022",5
Normally the game is pretty good however whenever I fight against Childe (or any fight with a cutscene) the screen darkens and doesn't allow me to continue the fight or quit out of it. Wastes a lot of time and effort when you reach the last part and it doesn't even let me finish the end.,4,"August 2, 2022",3
its amazing. I do have a problem but still it deserves 5 stars. I place in a samsung tablet and it was working fine until i got to springvale to defeat enemies and rank up but unlucky it started to glitch ALOT. Only bare color screens were there. Pls fix it and when i close the app music is glitching? pls fix but iverall geart game love it,1,"August 1, 2022",5
"Add skip button please. Like the amount of dialogue you have to go through is mind boggling.

"Mihoyo your updating system has a problem. I pre-installed for the game a day ago and when I updated it, it suddenly restarted and downloaded 7gb. After that I left it unattended to update when I came back it decided to download 37gb instead. There is something wrong with the game so you better fix it. I don't know what I did wrong but there is a problem with it.",45,"July 13, 2022",1
it has been over an hour since maintenance has finished and my game has crashed 12 times the minute the u get into the game. it doesnt help reading all the horror stories with the lack of communication between players and the company so im not even sure if this issue will get fixed. i hope it does cuz im too obsessed with this game to quit.,2,"July 13, 2022",2
"The graphics are absolutely amazing but I will have to give it a 4 because of the co op experience and limited time events. For newer players, missing out some of those limited time events will ruin some players' experience of the game because well, simply they weren't just there to experience firsthand. Now the co op experience, it's very limited to what we can do like only allow co op within your chosen server which is disappointing because not everyone in one server speak the same language",1,"July 22, 2022",4
"I can tell by the starting screen the game is good but there is a FEW problems. 1. It takes FOREVER for it to load! i hate it. but i can tell its a good game when you dont have this problem, 2. It says my files are Not there :-( I have played on a different device and it works fine there. Please fix this!",1,"August 2, 2022",4
"It's an incredible game with a good story line and character lineup, but it requires SO MUCH SPACE. It also will overheat on mobile so much so that it literally burns my hands.

Effectively, I cannot finish the domain. Please fix this!!!",5,"July 23, 2022",2
"Except for the system where you can just pay to wish for any character you want, even though getting 5 stars as a f2p player is hard I think it's a nice challenge. The exploration is the real fun part of the game, and the storyline is also interesting so overall I would recommend it.",1,"July 21, 2022",4
Update broke my game. Repairing did nothing. Stuck on black screen after entering. Soundtrack still plays and it shows IUD at the bottom right Update: had to reinstall the whole game. Huge pain. I'll keep the rating because the amount of things you have to grind for have become unreasonable. It's a chore now instead of a fun game,3,"July 18, 2022",2
"It's an amazing game. Everything is just amazing. Character design, lore, even the small details. But there's two problems, the amount of data you save from really old events that just take up probably 2-3 gb. And the fact all sumeru characters are white. Bruh. If Natlan is all white I will be uninstalling. If this was fixed it would be 5 stars.",4,"July 13, 2022",4

"Amazing game, graphics are controlable you don't have to do quests, you can play with other people, it's amazing but the wishing system was really unfair to me.., I am ar 48, normally people would have about 3-4 five stars, but I only got my first five star at ar 45, it has been really difficult to complete quests,as because the five star is a support,i am aware that it's a system and not my luck, but I'm hoping miHoYo sees this and resolves this problem, but overall its a good game.",3,"August 2, 2022",4
So overall it's a pretty good RPG game it has tons of characters I can choose from and an interesting story but it started to do this weird thing that results the game to crash multiple times I'm playing on mobile and this a very big issue since it sometimes interrupts my gameplay so I hope you can do something to fix but it's a pretty good game though Ive grown pretty attached to it,2,"July 21, 2022",4
"This game is excellent, the design of the characters are great and the gameplay easy to understand when you are beginner.

"I'm still disappointed with the artifact stats and rolls make it so hard to build characters, especially as someone AR55+, which make me want to play the game for less time. The resin cap also doesn't help much when farming materials and artifacts for multiple characters, unless you pay for the extra resin. I hope there will be some optimization, because the game is making depressed and I'm getting tired of being hopeful that the game gets better.",1,"July 13, 2022",3
"Amazing graphics cool characters (my fav is qiqi ) I Really recommend this :D but, i bought allot of furniture and then tried to customize my serenitea pot but it said something like ""this function is undergoing maintiance please try later"" so i tried the next day, and the next day, and even today i cant customize it! I hope it gets fixed, i think its a glitch! :( by the way, i think the prices for primogems are a bit too high! And yeah, this game is amazing and has a great storyline :D",2,"July 29, 2022",3
"It's a great game, high graphics and really cool art style but the thing is, a lot of bugs for mobile players, especially the Signora, Yun Jin and Dvalin texture bug. please fix these problems as soon as possible. Overall the game is really fun and would really reccomend",3,"July 13, 2022",4
I love this game I've been play for months and there's a problem for some of a mobile player like we don't have a grass and we can't see any text damage and when we do the ice bridge on the water we can't see the ice and now after the update of the 2.8 I can't see the enemies hp.I hope you can fix this thing thank you! I enjoy playing your game.,2,"July 30, 2022",2

"This game is the best! I like the graphics, the characters, the story, everything. There is only one common problem: the storage.

"One of the best games I've played in while. Also , a bit too addictive for me, have to take a break. Needs a few tweaks but all good 👍🏾9/10 .

"The art is beautiful, the character are well made and the music is top tier. The game is soothing to play but I wouldn't recommend grinding it. All of the quests have a very heart warming story line and I'm glad that I decided to play this.

"Absolutely love this game, the graphics and everything is just a chefs kiss, tho i think everyone would love a bit more resin. Most of our luck is rlly bad and with new elements coming out the rates are going to drop, which will make it harder to get the stuff we need, other than that love it :)",28,"August 6, 2022",4
"The game refuses to implement QoL changes, and it also refuses to fix bugs that were in the game from a long time. All-in-all, the game is still pretty good. Of course, the game at the beginning will be amazing and you'll find yourself playing for hours every single day. However, your passion in thjs game would fizzle out, tho it still keeps you motivated in playing it due to new maps, characters, stories and events.",43,"July 13, 2022",4
"It's a beautiful game with really nice lore and wonderful characters. There's a lot to do with even more things coming soon. The only downside I would say is if you're playing on mobile, it will feel like you're phone is about to explode. You can still play it but I'd recommend console or pc. The download is long as hell but it's pretty worth it. The gacha aspect is really addictive and it's hard to not spend money on this game. It's not for everyone but I still highly recommend it!",0,"August 11, 2022",4

It restarts ""repairs"" it but run integrity check again. Files still missing. What's missing? I have a legit from Google play copy. Maybe what the issue is...idk.

"The game is good. Quests, maps and combat is fun but endgame content is repetitive. Endless grinding just for a new character you got gets boring after a few minutes.

It's just pale and brown skin.",2,"July 19, 2022",2
"This is probably the best game ive ever played, i love how you have alot to do in the game and can never get bored playing it but it can get pretty overwhelming especially for new players based on what i experienced bcs you need to catch up on your quests but overall its a great game,you really need to play it alot if you want to level or build your characters you also need to farm for your characters abd weapons and thats where it gets overwhelming especially if your busy like a student like me",0,"August 11, 2022",5

I guess I'm going to have to stop playing because I am not starting over. I had almost all my *4 chrctrs C6 . & 15 *5 .",1,"July 28, 2022",3
It's a great game though underrated the graphics are great just so that every one knows this game has a nuclear bomb waiting for you inside when you first open it you need to download an internal data of around 2364mb it's a 15gb game. But it's good it's worth it my problem is when we unlock new story or archon missions their are certain characters you that shown up and we get a trial but we never get them like the beginning of the game like Kaya so a request give a charecter afterevery10thmissn,1,"July 24, 2022",4

"Game that can compete even with AAA titles on console or pc. Have put 800+ hours into it, good quality free game experiences but the phone requirement is very high.

Overall I really like this game and I spend a lot of time playing it but sometimes it feels really annoying when a puzzle is excessively difficult and then I hardly get any reward and it's overly difficult to gain characters.

"I'm going to be 100% honest this game is fun. The combat, exploring, and story is amazing! I love everything about this game, but the one thing that's stopping me from giving it five stars is farming for artifacts. I used 12 fragile resin which = 720 resin and only got trash! Can you please fix artifact farming so it's more consistent, or you could fix the resin refill! It takes roughly 21 hours to get 160 resin only to use that resin and get nothing beneficial for your character. Fix farming",12,"August 4, 2022",1
"This is a nice quality gacha game with plot and stunning character design, wonderful music. But there are a lot of fundamental problems, such as, lack of content on high Adventure Rank. Characters are beautiful but their price is way too high. You get a guarantee after pulling gacha 75-85 times, but even that won't give you 100% for the character you desire. You will have to spend another 75-85 pulls. This is very expensive for a mobile game in my opinion.",1,"July 13, 2022",4
"before getting to the other parts of map you battle and its fun, then after you beat the first part to advance to the other parts of the map where you can travel by boat, just gets repetitive and boring, think I'm done playing but who knows , maybe make it easier to grow stuff in the teapot, I think it will take a couple months to complete all the tasks to do that, takes to long to do stuff, probably played almost a year to get some of the other parts of the map specifically the waverider.",1,"August 4, 2022",3

The game is good at first but you will see the problem once you get on higher levels. The company is not listening to its community and the new characters are underwhelming.

I love this game, though it's hard not to stay up until 2 AM playing it . . . The reason why I give this 4 stars however is that this game requires a lot of storage, so I recommend using PC or a tablet.

"The game content is great. The gambling aspect will never be enjoyable to me. It's also unnecessarily difficult to manage your account across platforms. Genshin is impressive for a mobile game, there's a lot of content and it's not terribly heavy on grinding like some MMOs. It's fun to co-op; a little inconsistent with what is solo and what can be done together, but eh. Hoyoverse isn't great at listening to the fanbase outside China. They can also be a bit stingey with long term player reward",1,"July 13, 2022",4
"This game is really amazing, lots of fun places to discover and lots of monsters, quest, levels, new characters, and some friends to make. I love the game and recommend it for others who like roleplay and fantasy type games.",1,"August 1, 2022",5
"I love the game, it's lore, events etc and I'm really excited for how the full teyvat map turns out! but for us ""end gamers"" please add something to keep us entertained like a little minigame that could give us 20 primos everyday that lasts forever ( for example fighting enemies ). Overrall I would love to hear about future updates for genshin!",1,"August 8, 2022",4
"This game is beautiful. The graphics, the scenery, especially the characters😍. This game is great as it is a great way to bond with family. However, a lot of the games' fans are creakheads. I've been hearing about threatening and insulting the characters' voice actors because they don't like the character or even making fun of this game for not giving them the character they want in the wishing system. It's a great game overall, but the fantom needs to stop.",0,"August 7, 2022",5
"I first rated this as 5 stars because it's truly well made, but I have new concerns. Positives first, the regions are beautiful and super fun to explore. The plot and lore are also super intricate and incredibly intriguing. HOWEVER!! There is also a major lack in representation!! The in-game regions are based on real places and cultures, right? So why are almost all the characters as pale as paper? Also, it takes up so much space. It can be very hard to play on mobile because of this.",5,"July 13, 2022",3
"Absolutely love this game, I wish there were more Dendro characters, sm. I love Dendro, I also wish it explained where to go during quests a little more, and while in the chasm I have no idea where to go, it's v v confusing for me. Otherwise this game is super fun and amazing, gladly give it 5 stars ❤️ also please try putting more poc representation in the characters, I love Kaeya and Xinyan but there's only 2, there's should be an more 😞",1,"July 13, 2022",5
"Although the game play is good and the graphics are beautifully done, the inability to use controllers is a bummer and I'm probably going to play on another platform. It's a pity though as this game would have occupied lot's of down time when I'm out and about.",0,"August 13, 2022",2
"Amazing game, very interesting story plot, and also an amazing community. This game has so much lore and story while having a fun adventure.

"Okay so, i need butterflies to get potions but it's so hard to do it in mobile because it's slow – plus i really think you need to create a device to catch butterflies easily, especially for low ar players like me. – It's really hard to catch butterflies and fireflies in mobile.",4,"July 27, 2022",2
"This game is nice but... It's just one problem on the ''Masanori"" it's hard to beat in one minute. It took me so long to defeat it and im stuck at the third fight meanwhile can't co-op with other player. I think I'll try my best to defeat it but it's wasting my time to defeat the ''Masanori"" again and again. So I will give it four stars instead. And at least this game make my day getting 5 star characters, co-op with friends. But somethings the task was unable to co-op with friends.Thats all. :)",0,"August 7, 2022",4
alr. I think its about time i change this review it used to be 3 stars because of some resets to the game and everything but recently i decided to try the game again and i have been having a blast. the game is great and im always excited for more the only problem for me now is just the amount of space it takes... i mean seriously 14 gigabytes are alot but other than that its great,0,"August 8, 2022",4
"Huge game which has several updates each year, and has TONS of content to never be bored, then has storytelling, beautiful art and art styles, and a huge world to explore, the downside to all this is that you will need a pretty good phone but I'd say it's worth it.",1,"July 15, 2022",5
Great and amazing game!! Plus absolutely no ads! The graphics are very nice and the characters are spot on 😉 I just started playing today and love it already 😀 😍 but the only thing is that when u first go into the game I had to wait a day for the data thing to load but still amazing game and with for a 10 star!,1,"August 3, 2022",5
"The graphics, gameplay, storyline, quests, characters is all very good. I would recommend this game but the only problem would be a little inflexibe gameplay in co op mode like we can't trade items or drop some items etc but rest everything is great",1,"July 13, 2022",5
"The game is great although im suffering from issues like i cant see the ice bridge, grass or even the damage text itself so hopefully you guys the devs can fix this bug i really like the game, actually im not the only one who suffer from this issues other players do. So hopefully in the incoming update it will be fixed🙂",1,"July 26, 2022",4
"The game's graphics are really good, which makes the gaming experience cooler,but what didnt like is when people come to our world in co op and just take our resources without asking. Thus,many reject other people's co op request,thinking that they will be stealing their resources.This spoils the fun of those players who want to play with others.If there is a setting that allows the players to choose whether others can take the resources from their world,this problem may be solved. Thank you :)",2,"July 27, 2022",3
"Doing better this go around in my opinion. Been back off and on ,I tended to leave on bad updates which was basically all of them game still is geared towards PAY TO WIN/PROGRESS but not as much now and noticeably more rewards, my main issues were& still are lack of progression due to levels, so far that aspects seem to have changed but will update review upon playing a bit to actually see of that's true, other issues is the phone OVERHEATING SEVERELY🔥🔥 and I have an s22 which is hot already.",4,"August 6, 2022",4
"My experiences were very good so far.The events r fun and the game itself is overall really fun,I also made some friends.Anyways since the latest update,it seems that my quests doesn't progress if I don't exit the game,like for example I did a world quest & the same dialog would keep repeating if I don't exit the game & reload again.I even tried verifying the file but it said it needed no repairs,my wifi connection is gud so idk why it does this.It only started happening since the latest update",2,"August 4, 2022",4
The lore and the whole experience is just superb! Every character is well-written. The modeling of the landscapes are also awesome. I just wish there is more content to do once you reach a higher level.,2,"August 2, 2022",5
"This is probably the best mobile game on the market, it's even more cudos being that its free to play. It gets pretty deep and it's kinda complicated at times but when you keep going you get the hang of it and it totally pays off. It takes alot of concepts from LOZ Breath of the Wild which is a great game and with the anime theme and deep character/story development it makes for not only a great mobile game but a great game in general. If you like RPGs I would highly recommend Genshin Impact 👍",1,"July 13, 2022",5
"Its pretty nice graphics, i play it on my pc and on my mobile when im away from it or just want to lie on a bed, cross cross-play/progression is really nice, only down side on mobile was the new game cutscene froze 2x for me, i could hear the sound bu the frame froze till the choice cutscene, then froze again.",0,"August 13, 2022",4
"It's amazing and runs sooo smoothly, I have absolutely no problems. As for the game it self it has really nice graphics and amazing development. I just wish it was finally available on the switch and controller compatible on smartphones",1,"July 14, 2022",4
"I gave a review before regarding to the bugs to Dvalin, Signora and Yun Jin and thanks to the previous update when the 2.7 came and it all fixed, I can now finally play them well without any problems. Overall, the game is good, they were satisfying and relaxing even though there were difficult times. Keep on the good work Hoyoverse.",1,"July 13, 2022",5
This game is interesting but there is one problem 1) I can't see any numbers at all (I think some people also deal with this) and it's hard for me to see my damage hence I can't improve my character. 2) I can't see any ice hence I don't know where I need to go and when the ice bridge is gone I need to repeat the whole thing again n it's annoying. That's all I hope your team can fix this thank you.,1,"July 13, 2022",4
"The game is very fun, but can you guys fix the damage text for not appearing in a low-end device like mine. Maybe put an option on settings to turn on/off the damage text. Thank you!",2,"August 3, 2022",3
"I can easily rate this game 5 star because it's an AWESOME game. You must play it if you have a great device. So, the thing I want to talk about is the traveller (main character). In the current elements that the traveller can access, the traveller isn't that powerful. Since he/she is the main character, he/she is one of the weakest character. So I request the creators to make the traveller more powerful in the upcoming elements he/she can access",1,"July 15, 2022",5
"I love this game, but now there's a new problem. I am completely unable to play it. I check the file integrity and it says some files are missing or something. I go to fix it. It should be fine. No. I go in game. It either crashes on the loading screen, or crashes shortly after I enter the game. I don't understand what's going on. I didn't see anything saying that there's a new update or anything. What's happening? I even logged out of my account and deleted it and reinstalled to try and fix it.",1,"July 27, 2022",3
"i love this game, i have been playing it for nearly a year, im on mobile, yes it uses at least 20gb but i think its worth it, the character designs, the scenery, its all beautiful. trying to get a certain 5 star, even 4 star can be very annoying however, it encourages you to spend money on the game, and the amount of primogems(currency used for the gacha system) you get for the amount of money you spend i feel isnt enough. overall an incredibly good game!!",1,"July 24, 2022",4
"I really want to like it, but it keeps restarting from the opening cinematic. 07222 update - been playing for almost a year now, and I love the story so far, and have obtained 3 desired 5-star characters. It's a VERY stingy gacha (although the Welkin is a good deal), and it sorely needs an in-game pull-counter please. Players need to track it themselves for the guarantee, so I'm hoping this gets considered.",1,"July 13, 2022",3
"Wonderful game, very fun to explore and get lost in. On PC at least. Controller support is needed for this game on Android, there's no reason it shouldn't be here as it's on both PC, iOS and of course console. People have been asking forever so it's not as if it's a niche request, whatever BS is keeping them from releasing it is unfair to the Android player base.",1,"July 22, 2022",2
"Updated review for 2.8 onwards; the game is great first off, it's impressive a 3D open world game runs well on mobile and continues to be optimised. The character design and the art of the game is what really sells it. Once you get into the story you'll be hooked, with their also being massive potential for improving the story in the future. However, I only gave 4 stars 'cause of glaring issues like standard 5-stars not being guaranteed, thus me not having 1 Mona after playing since launch.",194,"July 14, 2022",4
Now that I have reached inazuma it has been crashing wayy too often. It doesn't lag really but just randomly crashes and I cant play for more then 20 mins without one happening even on the lowest graphics. Its sad really. Only chance I have of enjoying playing now is waiting for the switch version.,2,"July 16, 2022",3
"I've seen amazing ads, videos, and other things about this game. Being highly intressed, I decided to download it. However, everytime I open the game up, all I get is a black screen.

"Still no controller support years later despite it being available on every other platform the game exists on (iOS, PC, and console). They either have seriously lazy devs or sold out to Apple at the cost of comfortable controls on Android. I don't mind touch controls in games where you can remap the button locations. In games like COD mobile, I prefer a claw hand position rather than a controller. However, you can't remap the positions of the buttons in this game.",23,"August 11, 2022",1
"Hello! I have been playing Genshin Impact for about 1 year now and I really enjoyed it. But I have a problem. I can't see any damage text, ice bridge, grass, and the water glows too.

"character designs are ok. i'm begging you, can you remove the goddamn timer in spiral abyss??? like it literally makes players so frustrated. and the devs just assume you can beat the first 3 floors in under 5 minutes???? get a hold of yourself. just remove the timer in spiral abyss, it would make it much better.",2,"July 28, 2022",3
"Open world, puzzle-adventure, team combat, third person hack-and-slash, that requires you to be both exploring its map AND grinding domains for the perfect equipment for your character. Good story tellers. It can feel grindy if you don't play with friends, but the frequent updates and events keep us coming back. Free to play players can be great too, but needs good luck/money for specific chars you want. Edit: After 2 years, I'm still playing it daily and get excited for updates.",9,"July 13, 2022",5
Greatest game I've played on Android. Maybe all-time. One problem ! The installer takes forever to download resources and keeps trying to download over over even after I've downloaded the resources. Any fixes??? Please let me know. Otherwise def. One of my favs. And worth the 30/35 dollars I spent so far.,1,"July 14, 2022",5
"Great game but whenever I play after a while my game pauses and says ""Genshin Impact isn't responding right now"". And it gives me options on what I can do like ""Close app, Wait & Send Feedback"".This has been happening for a while and it has been annoying. Please check this issue & if its just me then I dont know what I will do.",3,"July 17, 2022",3
"Alright I'll be honest, first of all the game is fun. Lot's of great things to do such as you can explore and complete the open world puzzle and get a lot of primogems, but the only thing I dislike about this game is building your character It so hard to get the right piece with a good substat for your character. I've been playing since 1.0 but still don't have a decent cryo goblet",2,"August 1, 2022",4
"The game's world is absolutely beautiful, I'm an avid FPS gamer as always, but this game made me change my standards. Even at endgame, you just want to traverse the world, that's how the devs put their effort to make the world and environment. But still, I hope, their generosity increases more as the time goes by. ❤️",0,"August 12, 2022",5
"Beautiful graphics, great story line, easy mechanics The game is very interesting and full of intriguing adventures, apart from story there is a lot of gameppay and I would recommend you to play it However, I have seen a lot of babies giving this masterpiece very little stars because.....they don't have enough space for it? Why does the game deserve a low rating if it's a problem with your device and not the game? We should be grateful a mobile version exist and is free! After all, play it",1,"July 13, 2022",5
"I love this game so much already... fun, pretty, voiced, beautifully animated, lovely characters, what else could I ask for? Coming back over a year later to say this game is, by game standards, not perfect, but by gacha game standards is absolutely wonderful. Has a ton of depth, the characters are loveable, the game is updated at a decent pace, and it almost never disappoints. As long as you can handle RNG, you'll love this game.",1,"July 13, 2022",5
Mobile version is fine and cross save capabilities are great but the idea that ios has controller support and android doesn't is just ridiculous. And it's been that way for a long time now. Very disappointing.,7,"August 10, 2022",3
"Story is great with good lore. Music is gorgeous, awesome and immersive. Design UI is good, they improve it with main patches here and there (Use HoYoLAB app for best experience). Char design is average, has mainstream-ish females with few male chars. Three models only for both: kid, teen and young adult, so I miss having older chars to play. On Android works well and UI is good. My main issue is with plunges (Xiao user) but they're more responsive than ever and getting better.",29,"July 14, 2022",4
"I really like this game, it's fun, the graphics are amazing, the music, characters etc. but I have a problem with the lack of representation of brown/dark skinned people in the game. if you're looking for a game that represents you well as a brown/dark skinned person, this is not it. out of the current 50 characters we have there is a whopping 2 brown/dark skinned characters in the game right now, I think that speaks for itself. I hope in the future there'll be better representation for us. thx",1,"July 12, 2022",3
Could you improve game controls for mobile we can't control character after any movement like i have hutao but its not easy to control after her charge attack. If we already press any button that can't work we have to press again. In this time gape all buff gone in trash kildly fix this like pc if we press any button it has to press all time after animation. Waiting for your positive response.,1,"July 24, 2022",5

Actually its very addictive and it has cool stories, quests, and so much more! This game helped me relieve my Stress and it has been my escape from the reality of life.

Update 6-31 Thanks will do and update as necessary. Doesn't work. I would love to play this on my phone but no matter what I do I can't log in or even start a new game with signing up on new accounts. It's really unfortunate because I love this game on PS5.

"This is a great game but has an unholy amount of time gated RNG. The wishes to gain more characters and weapons is perfectly fine. But if you want to level,gain materials to raise there levels. you need to use a limited resource and that not including artifacts. I get that you can by buy it with real cash but there are people who can't do that . I get that this is a free game and y'all need money to allow the game to keep going but this is to much.

"I have been playing this game for a long time. What has kept me playing is the grind as I enjoy grinding but i will admit it feels like chores now. All the dialog is terrible. The best part is the characters. Gameplay is repetitive and eventually the characters which is the most entertaining part of this game, will become boring. I did enjoy the exploration to a degree. Cant say this suggestion will make the entire game better but im certain that alot of people want a skip all dialog button.",0,"September 8, 2022",1
Horrible customer service when reporting bugs in the software. I've been trying to get a quest glitch fixed and customer service first pretended to not know what the problem was and then said I needed to submit video evidence before they would even look Into the glitch. No chest appeared at the end of a quest when the item is needed to continue. It's been over 3 days of talking with them and it was never resolved. I also looked it up online and many people were having the same issue.,33,"July 22, 2022",1
Of all your updates this new one is by far stressful. I just updated it and said I am missing files. I tried clearing storage and cache but still ended up with the same issue I don't even know if its my phone or the game itself has a problem.

"A very nice app that you could go in a adventure and go anywhere you want just by playing I recommend it!! I love the stories so much and also the characters.. anyway there comes a time it gets kinda laggy and characters I use does glitch for other people. Some of the quest is kinda hard too (for me) I go depressed just by it because if I haven't finish the quest yet i couldn't go on co op.

This game is amazing the graphics and animation are so smooth but I would like to recommend that you guys put a mic on the co-op mode so that we can easily talk to our friends or strangers. I think it can help us to express ourselves even better 😁,1,"July 26, 2022",4

Rewards - The primogems gotten from events is extremely small. I'm not looking to spend days or hours to get rewards and then only getting about 480 primogems, considering ONE ten roll is 1600 primos. The resin cap has still not increased. Not to mention the ""diversity"" is just pale characters.",14,"July 13, 2022",3
I downloaded Genshin because it was very popular back then and I still enjoy playing it but sometimes I wish there were more content for AR 50+ players (I'm AR 55) so it does get boring every now and then. The pity system also stresses me out sometimes especially when I lose my 50/50 during a banner that I really want but have no way to earn more primogems. Also because your pity resets so I can lose my 50/50 at hard pity and grind for hours again because my pity's back at 0. But it's good :),1,"July 28, 2022",4
"The game has become repetitive. Doing commissions daily is such a chore and tiring. There's nothing new with the characters, the design are similar and so are the skills. There's not enough reason to continue playing the game once you reach the endgame, you'll just end up waiting for content to come and they'll make you wait for a long time. The game has become way too easy to finish, there isn't any challenge anymore.",96,"August 4, 2022",1

Played the game for a long time. Retiring once but returning and still have fun. I just came here to give suggestion 1. Please add more than 4 party option slot preverably 10 since soo many characters are present already. 2. Add option to quickly trade artifacts with another char. Or create artifact preset that can be chosen quickly. 3. Please steadily empower the mc. Our mc deserve multiple element use.,1,"July 24, 2022",5

"Personally i think this game is amazing! one of my favourite open-world games. with amazing music, graphics, characters, etc. i do have one complaint, id love for the company developers to listen to its fanbase, and consider being more generous with f2p players as genshins rewards system is very limited, and not allowing players to fully enjoy the game. id also love more primogems from comissions.",0,"August 12, 2022",3
"This game is really trying to make you use a lot of money and in the game it really shows. The game looks good and it has a good plot but it takes a lot of time to get primogems, you mostly get 5 primogems for one quest and you need 160 primogems to be able to get one wish and 1600 primogems to get 10 wishes so it's taking a lot of time and the side quests takes more time to finish so it's really not worth it to just get 5 primogems.",3,"July 26, 2022",2
"The game seems very fun but when I try to enter my username or password it said failed or error and I keep doing it with different users and passwords but it did not fix it it would have been a 5 or 4 if it had let me into the game, I will keep the game installed and try to fix it but if it doesnt I'm probably going to delete it",0,"August 5, 2022",2
"Relies too much on the ""temporary experience"" and ""gambler's excitement"" for content. And forgets the fact that players are wanting to get stronger but they choose to not let the players get any real progress, instead let them feel even more gambler's excitement. To the point the players get bored doing the same thing over and over and over and over again. Artifacts is layered with RNG, characters are hard to get, please do something about it.",5,"July 13, 2022",3
"Game is great and I highly recommend as a fun casual experience with a decent story and characters that you can get invested into, however, the developers do not seem to listen much to the community or at least they do not act on it. Some issues have slowly been addressed but took a loud voice to get any attention, but they seem to be getting better.",57,"July 16, 2022",4
"Game is great overall (amazing story, immaculate music, huge exploration, fun battle system and gameplay/minigames), especially for a free game, but I don't recommend it for anyone who doesnt have self control on their money as the devs will defenitely take advantage of your bad spending habits. They're great devs generally but they're not saints so exercise caution if you decide to play this game.",1,"July 17, 2022",4
Fantastic game overall graphics are incredible on a magnificent scale and the acting of the voice actors is overall so impactful and excellent and what's more the story line and allies and enemies that all come together is very satisfying and incredible out side the box like thinking so thank you for making such an incredible game where everyone can enjoy it,1,"August 1, 2022",5

Played for more than 1 year now",4,"July 13, 2022",5
I love it! all the characters are all well made and especially there past I personally think u should play genshin impact with friends aswell it's fun I wish there are more co-op events to play with friends but personally everything is fun! my fav character is YELAN her play style and her design is amazing I'm looking forward for the next few nations especially sumuru! 🤩,1,"July 22, 2022",5
"""Not worth playing if it doesn't support a Bluetooth Controller. If the game ever adds support for that then I'll probably play it again and actually get to enjoy the game."" I wrote this review 2 years ago and it still won't connect to my controller. I even looked up how to connect a controller and it still won't work. This game is a waste of space on mobile devices.

"An amazing game. Well written story, a wide variety of characters to play. You're able to play whomever you want and build them as you want. Though, there are some downsides, end game play feels like a chore with little to nothing to do outside of that unless you have friends who play the game with you. Aswell as with the release of Sumeru just around the bend, the lack of skin tone variety within the characters from Sumeru (beleived to he based around east Asia).",1,"July 12, 2022",4

"Unless you hardly spend time on the game, it's a waiting game and a grinding game for no reason. Wait for content, grind for literally any sort of progress while being timegated and spending a minimum of half a year to get a shot at getting a character you like, unless you get really lucky. If you're F2P you need to save for the limited time character reruns to get a 5* you want, but depending on when you start saving, you might just have to wait a year.

"Very nice experience for new players that have things to do. The game is almost 2 years old now and there still isn't any form of endgame activity. Pretty much everything that is added to the game is removed after max. 6 weeks. The devs are on the spiteful side and completely disconnected from the playerbase and dont really give us free stuff, ever. Meanwhile you need to promote the game for them for maybe 2 pulls (in the rare occasion where they give you free stuff). Game for short term fun.",0,"August 5, 2022",3

And that is, the creator of the teapot can load it. Some people like me don't invite players and do co-op, so we find it really annoying that we can't put as much things we can.

"It is such a nice exploration game, but requires a wealthy amount of grinding too and this game mostly targets to people to pay for the gacha wishing system but even if we dont pay, we are still able to wish and get the characters we want and spend wisely.

"It's good but after you've done all the story quests and archon quests it gets a bit boring and in my opinion i really think the characters and npc's can be darker than they are, especially if they spend so much time in the sun.

It ain't worth the effort anymore since progress is locked on resin. Wish and pity sometimes become excessively expensive.

Hoyoverse! Please notice this! This visuals and gameplay is amazing and every character is likeable and interesting but there are so many negative sides of the game that I hope will improve! My first statement is how genshin is such a daily game I don't always have the will play on it all the time and it takes months for me to create a big amount of primogems! The gacha system!

got pretty addicted to this game cuz its very fun... theres a lot to explore and you can do so much stuff so far theres not a lot of bugs that ive encountered and if your device keeps overheating or just getting really hot i recommend playing while theres a electric fan/fan in front of u (or you could buy a phone cooler so that it doesnt heat up fast),0,"August 24, 2022",5

"The bosses and rewards in this game just get incrementally worse and more uninteresting with each update. With each new region added to the game more and more enemies and bosses simply ignore your damage and have 100x the health of the previous region. You the player, however are capped at level 90 with your characters and level 20 with your artifacts. Currently in the latest region to do the weekly boss, it takes 30 to 40 mins to grind through their million health with damage reduction. Enjoy.",0,"August 14, 2022",3
"The game was good and all. Beautiful graphics, gameplay is good and ""was"" addicting. But at some point, the game feels beomes a chore - Kill weekly boss, spend your resin and complete the daily quest. Well,... this ""chore"" is not rewarding so why do it? At some point, I can't even open Genshin Impact. Why do the chores with so ""litttle"" reward. The game becomes exhausting.",23,"July 15, 2022",1

"Such an amazing game. A very wide and open world, and the graphics are absolutely beautiful. The wishing system is interesting but cool, but if you want a lot of characters fast, you most likely need to spend money. However, it does take a lot of space, currently 30 GB. I totally recommend this game tho, since it has so much to offer, the story is amazing and so are the characters. Definitely one of the best adventure games ever. :)",20,"June 19, 2022",5

I love this game but I dont enjoy it as much as I used to because it seems artifacts RNG seems to be biased towards DEF & HP. I have tons of artifacts where all the great substats go to def or hp circlet or goblet. The resin system also very annoying at endgame because you simply cant play the game enough as it just takes just 10 mins to finish the day's resins. I have bought BP pass & Blessings but I am never going to spend money on resins. Hence I end up not playing the game as I used to,2,"August 7, 2022",3

I hope I can give it a negative rating. Why can't your game work on mid entry phone? Didn't you have a cloud version of genshin? Why can't we have that instead of making it exclusive in china. That cloud version even takes less storage on your phone. It frustrating on the side of people who can't afford pricey phones or computer. We also want to play but won't let us eventhough you can already address this problem via cloud version.,6,"September 7, 2022",1
"I like the game a lot, but there is quite a few problems with it. The gacha system is too expensive, it's hard to collect primogems every day just for a couple wishes without buying any. Levelling up in adventure ranks is very difficult as well, there are only so many things you can do day to collect experience, the amount it all gives you is also really low. The third and final problem is just how big the game is, I've had to delete so many other things just to be able to even download the game",86,"July 15, 2022",3

"The game is good. A good game. Unnecessarily long dialogue with no skip option. Lack of communication with the community that plays the game. Lack of diversity.

The one thing I absolutely cannot stand is the lack of controller support for Android that you have on other platforms. Even if we ask it time and time again, you always avoid it.

Mobile players will inevitably face some backlashes like, lag, heat up, or game crash, but from personal experience, it's not so bad that one can't play smoothly for 2 hours.

You can barely fill an island with furnitures due to that annoying limit. And, the furnitures can't even be placed side-by-side with one another without clipping the game.

"Amazing game. Extremely entertaining and constantly changing. Beautiful scenery and solid characters. The only problem is the grind as you become an experienced player.

I love the gameplay but once you finish all the main quests the amount of things you can do just drops off a cliff. Not to mention the blatant and offensive colourism that Hoyo is showing towards paler complexions even while pulling inspiration from black cultures around the world. It's disgusting honestly. And don't even get me started on the difficulty of getting characters you want if you decide to free to play (f2p). I wouldn't spend money on this game or even start playing it. Do better,32,"August 23, 2022",1

Really nice game and graphics.it does take significant amount of time initially but later stages gets really slow and you actually need to wait for game update to play more. There's tons of stuff to explore but gets monotonous after some time.it was 1.5 month for me Update: How big this game is going to be it's already more than 20 gb now and cache will be more. tired of this 😫,0,"August 28, 2022",4
"Fun combat that feels fluid with detailed characters and environments. Every piece of architecture and every detail on the characters has a purpose reflected in the lore. If you like plotlines that pull inspirations from mythological texts from different regions of the world. Influences can be felt from Chinese, Japanese and Greek mythology as well as a heavy dose of Gnosticism for good measure. There is more than this but there's a character limit. TLDR; Good game with good world building",0,"August 6, 2022",5
Game for whales and the very lucky. Decided to try again after getting a high end tablet. Unfortunately adding controller support is too costly and Android users are the only ones stuck with trash touch screen controls.,7,"July 25, 2022",1
"I love this game so much, but come on, it's underwhelming to spend so much time in a game I really like and not get a single good reward for my efforts afterwards. It is not that difficult to give us generous rewards, but mihoyo isn't doing so because they just care about making money. Oh but let me tell you, if you keep behaving this way towards your audience, you'll eventually lose fanbase, and that'll hurt you.

"I started playing Genshin while being treated for breast cancer. My son introduced me to it & it has been a great way for me to relax & to take my mind off of the stress I've been under. I'm very impressed by this game, I've never experienced a f2p game that drew me in so quickly & even if it was pay to play this would be one of my favourites. It is truly an open world game that has so many places to see & explore, it also has a good fight system & many events to play in. Thanks Mihoyo!",1,"July 13, 2022",5

This was supposedly five stars but the ping is hella high. It's like 175 ms is the normal ping. It's always yellow tho I'm in the right server and my internet speed is doing just fine (Asia because im from Southeast Asia).

Seen the game reccomended online and was excited to download and play only to get through the tutorial and realise there is no controller support for Android.

Amazing game idk what I'm life would be without. This game is personally think that we should have a faster resin and more acitvtys to do when your ar 45 and more things get boring cause there's no more quests and theirs really nothing to do if we could have a mini game from our events like hide n seek in co op that way we can kill some time but one BIG Problem is storage their a lol of people who don't play on PC,1,"July 12, 2022",4
While it is a predatory gancha game with many mechanics designed to psychologically induce you to spend lots of money. The game itself is quite fun in of itself.

So I bought battle pass when there were about 10 days left . And it didn't unlock for me . I assumed my transaction wasn't complete so I bought it again . And I checked my account and the money was deducted twice but no battle pass . I thought maybe it will unlock when it refresh next time when the pass resets but no . So ye I bought the pass twice and money was deducted and still I didn't get anything for it . So I hope I either get a refund or provide me what I should have gotten . Thank-you.,0,"August 25, 2022",2
I'm discouraged by the gambling aspect of this game. Blatant money grab just like fifa's FUT packs. Otherwise would have been a fun game to play. I know it's F2P but it's paid subscriptions and products only provide you with more game currency to gamble with. Not provide a better experience. No incentive to spend money other than the usual allure of getting lucky and downward spiral of a gambling addiction.,3,"July 24, 2022",3

"Fantastic take on an open world rpg. You will notice that this game was built from the ground up and not like other cookie cutters out there. What appeals to me is that it's YOUR open world. So you won't see other players kill stealing, camping bosses, trolling or any of the other annoyances you'd normally find in your typical mmo. You can still with other players in your world or theirs so it still has that teamwork element. I can go on but it's better if you try it. You won't be disappointed.",3,"August 24, 2022",4

"For a mobile game it is really good in terms of graphics, gameplay and storytelling. It is not pay to win as there is no pvp, and the free characters are usually enough to get by. You can also save up primogems from events and quests for rolls.

Now you may be thinking, if she likes it so much why not five stars? Why its not five stars is the artifact RNG, the chances of getting good stats on a artifact is too low.

This game just gets worse and it's not even worth playing anymore everything just gets boring quick since it's so easy to and the worst part of this game is you do everything only for the people with money the f2p either have to use some money to actually get a chance or get nothing.

Very nice single player RPG. F2P is doable with a slight challenge at the start. The important part is the process in building the characters.

Some of the worst gacha I've ever seen. 5 star is a .6% chance... Get used to drawing one 4 star weapon and nine 3 star weapons. The premium currency is extremely hard to come by on top of that.

Otherwise,the game is a good game,just has some issues",1,"September 9, 2022",2
"I have yet to find any mobile game that work just like Genshin Impact (excluding Honkai Impact 3, of course). I'm a sucker for fantasy genre like FF and DQ, but it's hard to find the time to play those on PC. The fact that Genshin Impact is this good on phones makes it wayyyy up top compared to other RPGs.",0,"August 16, 2022",5
The best action adventure game I have ever played. It is an open world game. The fighting is very immervise and you can actually control the way you fight. Very easy controls. The world itself is very beautiful. It's a magical fantasy game.,1,"July 25, 2022",5
It's not a bad game I especially like the storyline and the voice acting the only problem is if you're on mobile you might not be able to see ice pathways or grass and the developers of engine's impact if you're reading this can you make it a little bit more playable on mobile,0,"September 8, 2022",5
"When i first downloaded it, i tought i was going to uninstall it fast, but now i can't stop playing! I still don't get it- why is this game free? I mean, the graphics, sounds, characters, story and everything is just awesome and way too advanced! Thanks miHoYo for releasing this game and keep it up! The only things i was unsatisfied about is that if you are not ready to grind, you would quit it after a couple of days and the artifact system with random stats is messed up",73,"May 31, 2022",5
It's been wonderful playing although there are some little bugs in the game it's absolutely wonderful. It has an incredible storyline too . I recommend this to anyone who is looking for and open world anime type game.,0,"August 9, 2022",5
"As a player for around 2 years now, I can say it will be hard to switch to another game after this one. Has the best graphics at your preference, best story, best background themes, you name it. But it does require luck in getting those 5 star characters just a heads up.",267,"September 4, 2022",5
"No doubt, Genshin Impact is one of the best games I played so far. I would even be an ambassador for this game if I had the chance. Despite that, I still feel the game is gradually becoming more and more plain and boring as time goes by. Have been playing since 2.2 and currently my love and hype for the game is decreased conpare to when i just started. Hope Hoyoverse can continue to add more fun events and improve the game! 😉",2,"July 12, 2022",5
"when ever you first get the game everything is very very confusing especially for the artifacts, this makes new people not want to play. when i first got the game i had no idea what was good and what was bad, it took me 3-4 months of trying to figure out what was good or not, i was just watching videos over and over.",1,"July 12, 2022",4
Thus game is absolutely delightful the character lore is the best thing that could've ever happend to me and the character design: BEAUTIFUL ❤ as ofcourse its still in the making I love how they update it every 40 days which gives us the full experience and we don't get bored. Genshin impact is probably the best action/fantasy game I've ever played 👍🏼🤌🏼,0,"August 24, 2022",5
best game i ever played so far. characters are quite cool but there are some point im unhappy about is that the new characters release are far more powerful than the older ones. but im still giving it a 5 since im satisfied with the graphic quality and the storage soace capacity.,0,"August 7, 2022",5

This game is really good! I've onky downloaded this game 3 days ago and I'm already addicted! It has really good character designs and loads of places to explore and have fun!

It's very good but i have one problem when you are in co-op usually you all chat together sometime i have a issue that the chat log suddenly bug or disappear the message and if you leave and comeback again the issue is fix again.

"How I know if an RPG is really good, one of a kind: I geek out on it. This is definitely one of those games. It's just that, there's a lack of ""end game content"". So that when you've leveled to the max, took all the quests, etc., for those people, they have nothing to do except dailies. However for someone who takes its lore and exploration seriously, and someone who has a job too, the game's events are a little fast paced. I haven't even done all quests! Overall, Genshin is a really good game.",87,"July 2, 2022",5
"A great game that I can't recommend on Android because for some reason the devs refuse to give us controller support. Game is extremely unwieldy on a touchscreen, and considering iOS has had controller support forever it's either they simply don't care about their android players or they have some weird exclusivity deal with Apple Either way, play it elsewhere, or not at all",0,"September 6, 2022",2
"I play this game for about a year now. And I gotta admit, this is the first game that makes me obsessed. You gotta admit that the storyline and the music in this game is top tier. But still, artifact grinding is killing those fun time, but I'll still consider playing Genshin from now on to the future.",0,"August 23, 2022",5
"I downloaded this, played a little and now am hooked! The graphics are amazing, though I use lower settings due to being an Android player. The characters all have unique backstories which pull you in. The scenery designs are stunning, I could stare at them for hours, even the story is extremely interesting.",0,"August 24, 2022",5
This game is really cool and its free to play there are no ads and the soundtack is amazing the graphics are insane for mobile and the game is massive. There is loads of story content and you can get all the characters for free though playing (there is in game currency too). The team are very genourous in what they give out through the in game mail. Also there is co-op. The updates are frequent and plentiful. I love this game to the bottom of my heart and will keep playing for years. Zhongli 😍❤,6,"August 31, 2022",5
"It's kind of unfair with giving artifacts, it takes months or so before getting a proper artifacts and for a character to be fully build. Hope you will fix this and make it easier for us to farm for our characters.",1,"August 24, 2022",4
"Revolutionary for mobile gaming. Out of all mobile games I've ever played this is by far the most incredible and it has a very high budget, so you get breathtaking animations and top voice acting (at least in jp dub). The gacha is very forgiving compared to nearly any other options out there and it is entirely optional because there is no PvP at all -- entirely PvE, and mostly solo with some coop elements. I would recommend this game to anyone, hands down.",53,"July 24, 2022",5
"Great game as far as game play, game animations, and graphics. Sad thing is most of the characters that drew me to the game have not even been avaliable. 80% or so complete with all game content.",1,"July 26, 2022",3

"Honestly really loved this game, the way they handled showing different cultures up until now has been amazing. But they've totally dropped the ball with the most recent region Sumeru, at least according to the information given so far. They don't respect the culture it is based on and mix multiple cultures together as if they are one. The character design for the Sumeru characters are horrible as well. I will change my rating if I see some improvement or if I am being to hasty with my rating.",6,"August 23, 2022",1
Very interesting game there's no pay2win. Alot of rewards entertaining adventure all around the map. Challenging grinds. However they should add constellation toggle for characters like Bennett. Overall it's very great game I recommended.,0,"August 24, 2022",5
"Best MMORPG Mobile game available at the time, Big World, 3 regions and 4 more to come, a lot of characters and each of them has a unique design and gameplay style. There is no game in the current market to even compete with genshin impact right now.",1,"July 21, 2022",5
I think this is amazing but I wish we could have clothes for Traveler because I started the game a few months ago and they never got outfits edit: this game is amazing I really hope I get ganyu I think players should get a chance to choose there favorite character and get it for free on this year's anniversary,1,"September 5, 2022",4
"Great game and characters, tho I hope you could figure something about the lack of endgame because it's starting to be a problem. Also, whats with all these hard puzzles that just stresses out players instead of having them enjoy. Atleast put a detailed guide for these quest and puzzles so we don't have to search up on youtube for guides everytime. Honestly it's such a hassle.",12,"July 22, 2022",2
"The game is great, the storylines are great, character design and lore is great, but the problem is the gacha. From what I experienced I from rolling in banners were not really great, it was extremely hard to get at least one 5 star,while the artifact grinding is kind of like a gacha for it does not guarantee you to get the artifact you need, and once you get the artifact you need it turns out to have horrible stats and sub stats. Leveling artifacts is also very horrible. Earning primos is hard.",2,"July 13, 2022",2
This game is awesome i should have given 5 star however there a problem I have facing many times when I enter in co op mode after sometime the message communication chat disappeared we can't able to see any message from other players while in co op mode to fix this we have to either exit or restart the game.please fix this bug.,1,"July 28, 2022",4

Its a good game had it on my ps4 when it came out but it's really not that f2p (free to play) friendly and it take so long to level up once your past level 30 it can get annoying but I do like the open world aspect of it and the very nice scenery,1,"July 23, 2022",3

"This is a great game that they put time into. The story line is great, but I do have to problems with it that make me want to give Genshin 4 stars insted of 5. My first complant is that you have to use moblie layout if you are on a cromebook.Second the game will take forever to load in and is sometimes glitchy. Characters will not load and will just show there face, & floors sometimes full citys will not load in and you will have to climb to places.Lasty starting today i can not join in today.",0,"August 12, 2022",4

And when I do place stuff it doesn't increase my serinitea EXP. I have no idea if anyone else has complained about that yet or it's just a me problem.",2,"July 28, 2022",2
"The game is great when you first start out but once you hit AR40 it starts to become a grind. Don't do the math on how ridiculous it is to get good artifacts, weapons or characters. They are making insane amounts of money it would be great if they weren't so greedy....",12,"August 15, 2022",2
I really like the graphics and the characters in the game are amazing. I enjoy the story as it goes on and on it is really fun! The fighting styles of each character is also really cool and facinating but I have one disagreement. It takes soo many materials to upgrade and level up characters and the world although fun to explore too wide to find stuff.,57,"May 16, 2022",4
"If you're here from PS to put to mobile don't waste your time. The game won't log you in no matter how many times you put your code. I tried 6 times it confirms it but won't do anything.

"This is the best game that I ever played based on my experience on mobile gaming. It literally balance everything like meta and waifus or even gacha itself. It totally friendly to f2p players (mainly for waifus) but more importantly, it has a knack ability to attract gamers with power creek attitude.

"Very fun and the exploration was convincing me to try this game, included the in-game lore. recommended for lore-nerds, you wont get bored of the mystery path you'll encounter. also, I was kind of disappointed about the comunity complaining about the characters skin from their own region and role, name pronounce that by their own VA's, and about this weird black-washing characters that they dont like about their original model. but it doesn't bother me much, I still love this game.",0,"August 25, 2022",5
"I've had a lot of fun playing this game for months now and it's story is one of the best ones I've seen in a game, definitely engaging and makes you wanna play.

"Grafically, one of the best games of its genre for mobile. But, the rigged pity system, the lack of end game content, the authoritarian measures implemented by Mihoyo shutting up all player during the anniversary, the anti-Christian lore, the rigged artifacts stats built, and other things, the 18Gb of space taken, make me think that all money I invested in this game was a waste.

I love this game. Its just I feel the endgame gets too boring and Ive reached this stage where the events are fun but im sure yall can do better. Also the graphics cud be optimised better. Also if there is a way to disable constellations it wud be better cause content creators who already c6 their characters cud showcase f2p guides with c0 for example.

They also promise 20 rolls at the start, but you only actually get 17 rolls in all. The pity system is also pretty unmerciful. Even with a welkin bonus + daily commissions, you don't get enough in-game currency for a single roll a day. I feel a single roll a day isn't much to ask for. That's only a 5* every 2-3 months.",14,"July 30, 2022",3
"Genshin impact is a good game with a gacha system, great characters and has a really interesting story. The reason why I'm rating this a 3/5 and not a 5/5 is because hoyoverse seems doesn't listen to the players feedback too much.

"The best game I ever played so far. The story and other mechanics are so fun and majestic. The game that will take you to a roller coaster ride of different emotions. Although my luck isn't that good, at least I have good characters that can accomplish those quest. But there is only one problem that I see, the storage of it. I know that my phone can still handle the next updates but then I am worrying what can it be in the future. I hope you can help us to lessen the storage. Thanks!",79,"May 28, 2022",5
"Incredible mobile game! It's no wonder it's so popular. Update: Version 3.0 is simply a Masterpiece. It is the perfect blend of Art, gameplay and character development. Truly an amazing time to come back or even start playing for the first time!",0,"August 25, 2022",5
"Early game fun, late game is a grind, once you hit ar 50 or above without burning out, you'll see there isn't much end game content, usually you wait for a new event or version for content, in the mean time you can use resin and do daily commissions, lack of a clear end game docks a star, otherwise, great story, characters, gameplay, and interesting worldbuilding",0,"August 24, 2022",4
I don't know why I'm having these problems as it sometimes doesn't let me switch the characters while combat and there was also an issue with the cursor for rotation. Please check regarding these problems. Thank you. And I really love this game.,1,"July 26, 2022",4
"As an f2p its painful but its still enjoyable. Edit: As player who experienced the 1st anniversary, I'm not mad because they just give 10 pulls. I'm just disappointed that there's no content or celebration to the 1st anniversary... I'll still play because I enjoyed the game a lot and story. The system of gambling just to have better performance is painful but you can ignore it and still play the game but with a little dissatisfaction. Recommended if your a casual player",0,"August 23, 2022",3
It was suppose to be good but there's too many glitches.. Like I can see through buildings and rain becomes green and objects suddenly become colorful etc.. please fix it..

"It's been like 5 or 4 months since I've played this game I love it it's fun and kinda addictive, The problem is hoyo gives primogems but it's not enough like events but can't do 4 pulls so it's much appreciated if there are more ways to get a lot of primogem Also if u lose a 50/50 next is gurranteed but why lose a 50/50 again it will be good if this is fixed because most are f2p who can't afford primogems",0,"August 16, 2022",3
"Overall, it's an amazing game, Amazing grapichs, awesome storyline, and a character that suits everyones style. Though i wouldnt reccomend playing on a chromebook (Like me) because it tends to be VERY laggy.",1,"August 4, 2022",4
"i've watched others play it and it seems like good game but no matter what i do i could never play it because it was too laggy or would ask me to log in again before it even started, I wish there was an option to turn down the graphics so that it would be actually playable.",4,"July 25, 2022",1
"I get the game is supposed to be hard, but I literally can't get through this quest, like it's impossible or something, each and every time I try to wish I always get a weapon instead of the character, I actually saved up to make a 10 wishes with primogem and got some stupid weapon. You have to play countless quests and spend a year or so to get 1 character and it's also very easy to die and even when you try to avoid dangerous enemies they still attack you. I think the game is fine though.",13,"June 6, 2022",4
This is a great story game so many quest and so very a perfect way to spend free time tho if you don't keep up with it and not play it for awhile it gets quite confusing so you would have to learn the ropes again,1,"August 4, 2022",5
"For a game that touts so many unique playable characters from the story, they sure make it hard to get them. And I'm not talking about pulls, I'm talking about limited banner runs that take months to a year to come around again with no other way to get characters you want. I enjoy the story and would happily pay to get characters like Venti and Childe but I dont even have the option. (I'm only in Liyue story btw)",0,"August 24, 2022",3
"The game is incredibly good. Have been playing for nearly a year now, at AR55. Events are good, storyline is good, and even if the artifact system isn't great, it provides a way for even high AR players to be challenged. But the new Golden Apple Archipelago event? Amazing. Fischl's mirage, however? That. That alone made me drop my rating from 5 stars to 1, just because they made the mechanics REALLY BADLY. Great concept, HORRIBLE execution. One of the worst puzzles I have ever seen, tbh.",15,"July 18, 2022",1
"A great game overall with events and a on your own time type of storyline. The gacha is optional so that's a definite plus aside from the fact you don't get very many free primos in general unless you actively look for chests, the currency system is well thought out too. My main and only actual complaint would be the fact that banners are too expensive if you do save for them.",0,"August 5, 2022",5
"I would put it as 5 stars but it takes way to much time for it install a new update.You can't skip dialog either. If these are somehow fixed or a bit better I could change it to 5 stars but right now it still needs a few more updates, even about the updates!",1,"August 25, 2022",3

"The game is great and has a lot of potential. The world is vast and beautiful, the characters are given every bit of detail they all need, and the events are fun. However, this game lacks permanent replayable content which makes the end game user-experience rather unsatisfactory. If you're looking for a game to play for a bit, Genshin Impact is good. But it isn't a good time investment as of now. This game has a lot of potential that a lot of people are waiting to see unraveled.",168,"May 6, 2022",3
"the game is very good! I love it! But it really needs an optimization, so that more people can play it and enjoy it without lags!

"So far so good. About 20 hours in and it's been a blast to play. You'll pick up the mechanics quickly. If I had to give one piece of advice just have fun with it and level the characters u like. Try to focus on just 5 for early game 1 of each element Update, been playing for a while since launch. My only real problem with this now is that if u close the app out (to answer a call or anything) u have to reload the entire thing. Very annoying",16,"May 31, 2022",4
its a good game but it has become too hard to play it on mobile there are too many crashes and freezes throughout the game when i am playing it. I have been playing scince day 1 and it ran perfectly fine on max graphical settings now its cant even run properly when its on the lowest possible settings. the freezeing usually occurs two weeks prior to the new update but thats only when its at its worst. can you please fix this i would really live to play the game more.,2,"August 23, 2022",5

"Honestly it is a best game,but after a while it really gets me bored for all the grinding you been working to. And not just that,the anniversary is a complete dissapointment to imagine that if you are F2P or free to play player and you played so hard in a year and the rewards are just 10 spin that you can get in just a month of playing this. Clearly that the voice and wishes of the player is not working in this game afterall.",4,"August 24, 2022",5

4 stars after 2 years of playing this game (AR59) The game is nice but it's all about quests quests quests and some new areas to explore every 2 patches. The game is really good but the content is repeatable. i just wish they add a buffed character :( itto's arms was a disappointment,4,"August 6, 2022",4
Great game but i suggest that maybe it would be a good idea to put in mini games to farm for primos when players have no more quests to complete or get bored of the events so that theres more things to participate in. Its also a drive for players to continue playing until their fave banner eventually arrives.,1,"July 14, 2022",3
"The newer content seems bland. New characters don't excite me anymore, and neither do events with rewards that are determined entirely by randomness and consist mostly of useless decorations for the housing system.

Unfortunately, recent character designs have shown that the Genshin art team is highly disrespectful towards traditionally non white/light skinned cultures and the upcoming Sumeru characters come off as ignorant at best and racist at worst.

I personally never actually keep playing a game for more than a month but I played genshin almost a year now. Genshin is the game that I hate to love and love to hate and it help me to go through dark times. Keep making a lot of event with a lot of primogems as rewards! And it'll be nice if you increase the max resin per day :D My humble suggestion: add a feature in serenita teapot like the practice wood thingy that can show your damage output,1,"August 6, 2022",5

"Not the luckiest player but, genshin gave me the characters i need to survive the early game and I'm glad for it. Also, there's a bunch of stuffs in game that you'll never run out of things to do so that's a plus as well. There's also plenty enough events that generously gave a lot of stuff which really does help a f2p player like myself. The only issue i have was probably the optimization for lower end devices, but considering how beautiful the game is, well can't complain about that.",5,"July 13, 2022",5
I play this on ps4 and I love how smoothly it plays. EDIT: the sound was resolved (thanks Mihoyo!) And I got more into the game and I really like it. I honestly can't find anything I don't like about the gameplay. It's a wonderful game that has truly stunning graphics :D,8,"August 23, 2022",5

This game is fun but theres not much do do at high AR level not much quests pretty much only commisions and the story quests that are unlocked with keys.

"While this game may require a lot of money to get a character you want, it is still fair. The pity system is easy to understand and everything is very smooth. I mostly play for the lore, because i find the world of teyvat intriguing, especially with the new chasm quests adding to it. But as much as I like it, there is a few problems, like the sheer size of storage it takes. Many cant have as much storage as needed and I think it'd be better if they decompressed the resources to a smaller amount",28,"June 2, 2022",4
I started playing this game cause my friend told me about it. At first I thought I won't play long but I kind of Got addicted to it.

Honestly I am beyond disappointed by this game's puzzles. The new event gave many players a headache instead of enjoyment. STOP THIS HARD PUZZLES. These are NOT necessary for the game!!!

Everythingbis wonderful and I love the plot and fighting.,0,"August 10, 2022",4
Mihoyo carefully crafted a gorgeous open world with an amazing OST. The gameplay is fun and can become advanced with the right characters. New lands and adventures are regularly added at no cost! The wish system is forgiving and offers a guaranteed 5* after a set number of wishes so you can plan for the characters you want.,6,"August 3, 2022",5
"Overall nice and one of the best game ever. But needs some minor improvements. Give optional download for voice pack. Tired of reading through side mission sometimes, availability of voice pack would make the experience the best. Increase more co-op and multiplayer activities. Fix latency(ping) issues. Except these, I find everything else as best in Genshin Impact",53,"June 23, 2022",4
This game is full of fun! When they said open world they ment it. You can go almost anywhere and climb just about anything. Such a beautiful game too!

As a person who's been a player for almost 2 years now, I'd say I've done almost everything there is to do and I can't play like I used to. My advice is don't rush and don't do everything at once. Take it slow and enjoy, new content can take a while to catch up if you do so.",0,"August 24, 2022",5
"Most of the game is great. The music, the art, the combat, etc. is all fantastic, but being time limited by resin is definitely a hindrance, especially with how much you have to grind to actually build characters. But by far the worst part is the business decisions by Mihoyo like how the weapon banner is still a scam (although it used to be much worse) and how character interactions won't work because of shaky reasoning that doesn't really make sense. Barring these, the game is pretty good.",70,"August 17, 2022",4

This game is actual trash. They gate progress and game mechanics with RNG gear that has lower rates for the stats everyone uses on top of betting on a 1/10 chance on whether or not it's the right stat. It's been an issue since the game released and they haven't addressed it at all. I've spent months wasting my time farming for singular pieces just so I can use a character.

Although borrowing names and cultural practices from Africa and South Asia for the new region, every single friendly or playable character is extremely pale or maybe has a light tan at most.

Atleast increase the amount of primogems from Spiral Abyss or events or lower the pity which makes player to continue the game in a fun way instead of doing grinding only.",19,"August 25, 2022",1
"Hi. I've been playing for half a month now. It's such a fun ride. I met a lot of friends, bond with my younger sister, and even found peace in the game.

"Very entertaining and one of the best I played so far. Highly recommended, but here's some key factors to point out: - Items from the chest are flying all over, have to be manually picked up every time except in the domains. I find this annoying. - Low mora rewards but upgrades are very expensive in terms of mora requirements aside from the other prerequisite items to upgrade certain characters and weapons. - Low reward/item drop rate even in bosses and difficult tasks/events.",364,"May 30, 2022",5

I know, i know the anniversary rewards kinda sucks but that doesn't mean we have to bad mouth the company, mihoyo genshin impact thank you for making this game! This game is really fun!

Especially in coop! TY!!",0,"July 31, 2022",5
"The music and art are 10/10, but the lack of endgame content and communication between mihoyo and players is shockingly bad. They have been getting more and more greedy, ignore our requests to fix the resin cap or the resin recharge rate, and there have been many unfulfilled promises to us. We want to recieve road maps and updates on what is planned for the future, its really disappointing that a game with such immense potential is let down by the marketing team and customer support.",30,"August 12, 2022",5

I HAVE ONLY BEEN OFF THE GAME FOR ONE DAY AND YOU WANT ME TO DOWNLOAD IT WHEN I ALREADY DID!?! YE SO THATS THE REASON WHY I GIVE IT 3 STAR!

Will give a better review once problems are rectified.",2,"July 12, 2022",4

By all means, please tell me who in the entire Lost Galaxy would want to have to dedicate an unholy 15 GB or more of their device's internal memory JUST FOR THIS GAME!? This has gotta be the worst case of an app or game being a massive space hog, and it's inexcusable.

Game is fun till you hit end game and have nothing to do because you've completed all quests. Spiral abyss is not enough for end game. The company is colorist. They took an black woman from history to make a character and whitewashed her. The company lacks communication with its player base regarding any upcoming characters and patches always waiting till last minute to even show anything off. Too much world and character lore is hidden in one time only events so new players never see it.,5,"August 23, 2022",2

"Do not start playing this game! This is the worst bait and switch game ever. First, you start off in this brand new world full of possibilities. The main story is amazing and there is tons of exploration BUT for whatever reason the developers want to drag this game out for 5-10 years (literally! google it). So after you finish a small part of the main quest you will be stuck doing side quests and random chores. This game should be called Chore Impact bc it feels like a chore. Dont get sucked in",0,"July 24, 2022",1
"The developer has a very good response, and the game is not boring, there is always something new in this game.

A great game but Being an endgame player is the worst in this game. Pretty boring in the end and rewards sometimes are not even generous. Also the artifact system and resin system needs some major and helpful changes because it's really off.,28,"July 24, 2022",1

Totally exceptional. Literally one of the best game I've ever played. P.S - make sure to have a really desent processor and ram. Playing it in low is really degrading.

Amazing art. Nice story so far. Fun game play. Beautiful world. BUT THE THING THAT RUINS THIS 5 STAR. The gacha system will eat your money. BEWARE WHALES. And it's very completion heavy to progress.

"Actually the game is fun to play. For me the 1st anniversary rewards are fine, just that I don't see their efforts to celebrate the anniversary with players and there is nothing they give to commemorate the anniversary.

It's a good game I really like it but I found the gliding lincese exam to be difficult since it was my first time playing this game so I would recommend other set of controls for the player while gliding to drag the controller up to make the player's character move up and down for the same way. And to let go of the controller as a way for the player to go down simply and land in the area.,72,"April 16, 2022",5
Genshin impact is a beautiful game. You can go adventuring with your friends! You can explore new areas and unlock new characters. But it's very time consuming is the only thing. That's the only reason I don't give this five stars.,0,"July 23, 2022",4

its very good game but first child is too good of a fighter for a villian so that is bad and villains should always be not so good and that makes a player that ik likes child and not hate him as they should so i am going to change my 5 star to a 4 bc of that second i love this game but if u r playing a laptop or a pc or any device that has keybaord then it is soo confusing and complicated to memorise and change or make all the keys the things to open stuff but for phones and ipads or tablets u d,0,"July 14, 2022",4

Great game wether your logging in for few daily quests or story line. Wish there was more to do in co-op though.",16,"May 24, 2022",5

"In my opinion it's probably the best game ever. I usually have a hard time playing games and get bored easily, but with Genshin impact the story line, the side stories, the quests, the fighting and the animation is truly so amazing.

"The game overall is good. It gives nice player experiences such as quests, battles, and probably events. The story of the game is amazing.

"This game is one of the best open world game . The grafix is really good. The story is also very interesting and who can forget the amazing sound tracks .

"Used to think that this is a better and is starting to regret investing. This game hss onenof the worst pity and rolls because in every rolls, you're guaranteed to get def. When will it improve? That's why a lot is moving on to another game because of this redundant issue. This game is slowly getting suck. I just hope there will be improvement soon if you don't want to lose players.

"I have been playing genshin for so long, and My only concern is that you guys keep on bringing modern items into the game when it's supposed to be a historical game, I like the genre right now, but I don't want this game to turn into one of those games who only do hangouts. You guys keep on bringing modern items into the game and it kinda pisses me off to the fact that this was supposed to be a game, the modern items don't even fit into the genre anymore. Like, cmon, it's really annoying.",1,"June 22, 2022",4
"It's fun at first. But it's a very flawed game, which becomes apparent with time/play time. Each update the game gets less new & returner player friendly. 70% of new content is limited time only 1-4 weeks and usually requires you to be completely caught up on the story+adventure lv which is very tedious. The limited time events can contain well made story & unique gameplay/locations that will likely never return. There are many problems but fomo/LMTTIME content is the worst! Also no end game.😭",41,"June 22, 2022",2
I love this game and all of the characters and been playing ever since it came out. But the reason I will give this a 1 star is because of the representation in the game. The new upcoming characters are supposed to be represented and have more darker skin tones. I feel highly disappointed on how white the characters are and why there aren't many darker skinned characters. Hoyoverse please make more darker skinned characters,2,"July 16, 2022",1
I had to delete that game because it's been making my phone act crazy. I'm so sad now because Genshin is super fun and now I can't play it anymore. Hoyoverse please try to make your game more compatible with mobile devices! I'd really like to play again as soon as possible.,1,"August 11, 2022",3
"Amazing attention to detail, true RPG fun all without the NEED to spend one red cent. I mean, you can if you want to.. I'm not gonna lie, I played for a minute without spending cash, to see what it was like, it was great, totally fun. Then I spent some cash, it made some things easier however not enough, to me, to justify a NEED to buff with cash. The new update is awesome!!

"This game is very fun compared to others. Unlike other games, this game has a lot of lore. Even unimportant npcs have background stories which makes the game way more interesting. There is a huge area to explore and the scenery is great. This game includes a lot of small details too. Quests are also very captivating. Music is great and matches different situations.

"Wait for a certain day to get items; Lootboxes but they are not that bad; Cool gameplay and all but a super slow progression.

The most fun games to play, but be reminded that this game as others RPG games need you to grind for your character to become stronger.

"Genshin has nice graphics and good story at the start. The game became money hunger when the inazuma was released. They are also that bias to shogun who has the most insignificant story line ever, especially the part two where they made her so innocent for whitewashing. Characters are also poorly made by recycling other characters skill. Game is getting a bit boring especially how repetitive the content is. The anniversary also sucks. The company itself is the problem, to much money hunger.",9,"August 24, 2022",1

"there's a lot to do in this game, but the biggest turn-off even for veteran players is the resin system and its endgame. most, if not all, character upgrades (weapon, talent, etc) are behind a resin wall. i know this is to increase the playtime that forces players to come back everyday for making their characters stronger, but it just feels so repetitive especially when there's no endgame content. the events are one thing, but talking main story-wise, there is not much to do. cant help but quit.",87,"April 8, 2022",3

"This game has very nice graphics and quality but personally I think there are many things that need improvement in this game, such as event and floor 12 in the spiral abyss difficulty. I also think that the developers should bring a potion/food that can refill characters energy. And last thing, I think they should increase the resin cap. Sometimes, players are busy so that they can't use their resin before capped. Although you can quickly craft 5 condensed resin, it's still not enough. Thanks.",254,"May 31, 2022",4

"Very fun but has a ton of room for improvement, especially at end game which devolves into a monotonous daily grind while waiting for more story to release. It's wise to just take breaks between patches, but if you're free to play you will feel like you need to play daily to get some of the premium currency used to pull new characters and weapons.

"Genshin impact is a really enjoyable with many great aspects. My favourite aspects are; the world is fun to explore and is entirety free, the lore of each region is intriguing with interesting nuances and questions, almost all playable characters have their own view on life and the world and it is fun to learn more about them. However there are things that can be improved; in general the English translation up to chapter 2 part 2 only serves to convey information and lacks character.",23,"May 27, 2022",5

"edited rating;; i really enjoy this game and all, but it takes up a lot of space on your phone. i had to delete the app because im unable to play ""because of low storage"" while my phone space is completely fine, and doesn't cause a problem at all; its bc the game uses up way to much space on my phone to comfortably play. but im lucky im able to play on ps4. aside from that, im really looking forward to scaramouche's banner. good luck to you all on your pulls!",1,"July 7, 2022",3
"Last update is probably the worst update ever. The best thing about this game is you can clearly see how much effort Devs put in this game, but not this time. The story of the event was such a disappointment. The puzzles are broken, it can't be solved. I'm starting to question if they even tested the game before updating it. I think this update was made by interns while the lead devs are working on sumeru project.",12,"July 30, 2022",2

Please do fix this issue",201,"May 5, 2022",4
Breathtaking landscapes to explore and the lores are top-notch. However the resin limit can be quite a turnoff when you're a high AR player.

the thing that infuriates me is the characters design. this game is based on all the different cultures of the world. all the other nations are nearly perfect except sumeru the nation in question is supposed to be inspired by the middle east. for example their ruler is a tiny pale child which does not represent ONE part of the middle east while the other rulers represent everything PERFECTLY. dont even get me started on the skin colors and all the other orientalist & stereotypical designs.,10,"August 17, 2022",1
"Amazing game, very high quality and the character designs always blow me away with the attention to detail, backstory and more! The stories are always great and the 2.7 one was very moving and I loved the animations for the backstory of the yakasha's.

"The game fun. Generally the pity/gacha system ain't as bad as I initially thought it was. Just requires some serious grinding to get enough pulling material. The artifact farming system is pure rng. Its annoying to deal with forsure but other than that, its a great game.",1,"August 24, 2022",5
Been playing for years but.. it is the best mobile game ever. The events and updates are always coming so you never run out of things to do. I really respect their hard work and effort into keeping us going with content. But I'm annoyed as someone who buys only on this game that it's one of the few that doesn't accept play points that we rack up from purchasing in their game to use when making even more buys. Just seems stingy they had option for all of about a day or two then gone,1,"July 11, 2022",3

"Fun game, but I would love to see an easier multiplayer option. Plus levelling up your characters, weapons, talents, artifacts, etc becomes requires epic levels of grinding, resin, and materials at higher levels. Some world quests are way too easy to get stuck on, leaving you having to give up on main quests or even the overall game quest, no matter what your level and your characters are at. I've had to ask friends to pass these levels for me so I can continue.",29,"June 22, 2022",4

Game play is very addictive and the graphics are like from a dream. For beginners it's pretty hard to understand and they need to get AR 10, which is pretty annoying bc you don't know what you can do to get to it. The gacha system is very bad for F2p, but I mean you need to get money someway.",49,"May 31, 2022",5

Game has amazing story and character design. Has a beautiful open world. I wish it was a bit more lenient towards its gacha system. Instead of gaining a pity at 99 they could have done something like punishing gray raven where pity is at 60. Other then that good game,0,"July 15, 2022",4

"It is worth giving it a try for newer players, updates every month and feels like a 60 dollar game with a lot of content. For older/returning players the 1st Anniversary was lackluster, hopefully 2nd is better. Artifact progression has been slightly improved but still an RNGfest. No real endgame content for about two years, so you'll eventually be only running these artifact domains between updates.",145,"August 30, 2022",5

Overall a positive experience. I love the versatility of each character's abilities and huge open world environment. However I do wish there was a way to store more resin or have an afk mechanism that utilizes excess resin while not playing. Hopefully when this game reaches it final area they expand it by allowing the characters to cross realms via the ley lines.,7,"June 24, 2022",5

Been ages since they gave iphones controller support but android is still stuck with touch inputs. Works pretty well but it causes my phone to overheat. The variation of character skin tone is abysmal and the game really likes to show off the girls' asses.

I personally love genshin impact but the one little bit I'm complaining about is the skin inclusiveness, the fact that there are only 2 ingame playable characters that are tanned and personally hurts.

"I believe sumeru update is really REALLY fantastic. The exploration experience and the facilities they put is really helpful. We didn't see much about the archon quest but making the patch period 5 weeks instead of 6 will solve that a bit. I can't describe how good the music is in sumeru because if you didn't listen to yourself, you're missing a lot my friend. It's just that good whether we're talking about the battle or the world themes.",9,"September 7, 2022",5
My brother and i love this game to the point of playing and grinding almost everyday. My only issue is the customer support and account protection which is quite concerning. My brother's account got hacked recently for unknown reasons. We already tried sending in some proof and details we can remember but to no avail has it resulted in anything. We have supported this game from the very beginning so i hope that you will also do the same for us players.,1,"July 13, 2022",1
"It's really fun for a technically free game. Would rate higher if there were more things to do in multiplayer outside events, or even just more to do in single player, because ""endgame"" gets old fast.

Nice game beautiful soundtracks interesting storyline but The new updates never seem to interest me anymore like how it used to but i really want the events to focused more on combat rather than making drinks etc never any new unique playstyles for any of the new characters The gacha system it sucks honestly 90 pity for a guaranteed 5*? it's not even the guaranteed banner character? 160 primos for 1 pull?

It's Such a good game with a great concept but why are they just not listening to their community or give free stuff that's not the only problem they also need to fix certain characters that is not working as intended or was the character intentionally made like that like yoimiya can't trigger vaporize there is a cooldown and weapon banners should be fixed.,4,"September 9, 2022",5

"The game is great, it has good combat, good story, and good exploration. However it does take a while to progress. I think the developers did this on purpose to make you try to explore every little detail which is a good idea, it's just not that fun to do.

With character designs of Sumeru region: skin tones mostly white (but NPCs of colour?) + not using cultural elements that could make designs much better.

"Recently came back to genshin and am slowly getting back into rhythm so my take: It's a nice game if you want to collect things or indulge in story, if you like to explore or enjoy loads of combat. I play on mobile and unlike a lot of these reviews, I don't experience any lag. Reruns come quite often, with powerful characters getting reruns every other update there's no reason to complain about not being able to get older characters. I recommend to just try for yourself, you might be surprised.",14,"May 30, 2022",5
"It's a really well designed action-RPG. Everything from the environment to the bgm will draw you in and then there's the characters themselves that are so well designed and voiced that it should be a crime because they will temp you to empty your wallet for them. If you want to be f2p, some self-control is required as well as making some hard choices on which 5-star you want. You will need at least a $200 phone to run this game and even better for the best experience.",8,"July 13, 2022",4

"Its a good game, it does require a lot of grinding though so if your looking for a game you can just pick up and come back to every few months this isn't it, constant farming just to progress. DONT rush everything though, the story is pretty much the only thing making the game anything other than just farming. If you rush through it you'll be bored out of your mind waiting for more content and places to explore besides the event every now and then.

The only downsides to the game is that it is not available on the Microsoft store and you have to download it through Google chrome and after you download it you have to wait like 30 minutes to actually get to play it not to mention you can't sign up with a google account when you start to play on computer when you signed up with google on your phone,0,"July 23, 2022",4

"I have two strong opinions about this game. One; the graphics and the sheer quality of the open world is amazing. Most of us, if not all of us, would come to a general consesus that in terms of gameplay, storyline, and character lore, Genshin is quite a spectacle. Second; the endgame itself is essentially non-existent as getting to a certain point would only hinder their progress or would make the players question their play time. If so, is there a way to communicate for system changes?",7,"April 22, 2022",2
I personally like it and it's very entertaining I gave it a four because it generally is really good it's just that it does get a boring after a while but when new events come out it's is more fun and I sometimes forget why we are traveling in the world so over all it's a good game,1,"July 13, 2022",4

I absolutely love this game with all my heart but recently had to quit since my phone could not handle it. the new update also takes a whole bunch of space I don't have.

"While many parts of the game deserve praise, still there are a few problems. One being some characters are considerably weak even compared to even less worthy counterpart(s) [indirect buffs may not really fit in as they reduce the flexibility of the characters]. Another is the artifacts which takes so much time to just get decent ones for a single character, and new characters keep arriving. Finally, wish all the developers be safe and sound during hard time.",2,"May 10, 2022",2

"Recently returned to the game, while this game is undoubtedly still the best mobile game it lacks what it once did at launch. There's nothing in the game that has been left in intentionally to wonder about. Maybe the release was incomplete and those mysterious areas later added was unintentional but it was those puzzling areas I enjoyed the most. It's missing that now, making it less about adventuring and exploration when there's no discoveries to be made beyond the quests.",26,"April 30, 2022",3
"It has been months since I started genshjn and even though with what happened with the anniversary drama and all, I am very grateful for this game for changing my life. Got into am artblock for months and was going through a boring and bad time thankfully this game both saved me and my time. Even though there are issues with the bugs, Resin shortage, Artifact problems and story pacing, for a free game . . it's already very very amazing!! Can't type long but it deserves a 5 star review :))",4,"May 14, 2022",5
"I love this game but I'm about to delete it. It's gotten to the point that the game crashes as soon as it loads and makes it past the loading screen. If I'm lucky and it does play, it's lagging and slow to catch up unless you stand completely still for 5 minutes, even then the problem isn't solved. If you're lucky enough to continue playing it through the lag then as soon as you enter combat it crashes. It's a fun game but I spend more time waiting than playing.",37,"April 10, 2022",2
"There are not many games that I've stuck with after an entire calendar year of playing, but Genshin has made that list. I'm about to hit month 14, AR58, and I still play daily. There are many improvements I wish the developers would bring. Bugs that have been around since early game, quality of life fixes players have asked for time and again. But overall the game is highly enjoyable and something you can enjoy for the long haul.",14,"May 30, 2022",4
"I really like playing the game because it has alot of characters, enemies, and items. Im already obsessed on the game because the graphics was sooooooooooooo good and the regions are really fun to explore. I gave this a 5 star since i know this game works hard and its a really fun. The only thing i hate is TOXIC PLAYER!!!!!!",1,"July 8, 2022",5
"Its been two Days and The Recources still havent loaded. How am i supposed to Play The game? Look, i get it takes time to load, but i left my phone off hoping it to load the next day, and it did nothing! It was the same amount. It was Dissapointing.",0,"July 29, 2022",2
"very enjoyable, love the game ! although it gets harder with the higher levels , and sometimes u can't go on unless someone helped you with opening the map in co.op mode nevertheless I like it",0,"July 30, 2022",5
"i stopped playing for a month now. this is an amazing game, it's hard to find ones like it. the reason it gets 2 stars is because of how little male characters there are. it's not even dismissable the comparison of male and female characters ratio. the fandom is also toxic if u say anything negative. I love the game and I will get back when the new region gets added. I will always love this game<3 please consider us who like male characters.",1,"August 23, 2022",2
I'm currently playing the game on ps4. Although it's available on the phone I highly recommend you play on PC or console. It's just not the same experience. The graphics are beautiful and they're a ton of things to do. Most complaints are with the mobile version. I tried and the game is so large and requires so much power; my phone was uncomfortably hot during load.,13,"April 25, 2022",5
This game is awesome. The fighting is so cool and the graphics are like the chef's kiss. But one minor complaint. IT TAKES SO LONG TO LOAD! I installed this game in the morning cuz it looked awesome. 6 hours later I am still waiting for it to load! But it is definitely worth the wait to see the awesome graphics and the gameplay is great. Overall this is an outstanding game and I totally recommend it to anyone who wants to get it.,2,"July 1, 2022",4
"the game is reeeally beatiful, and graphics are amazing, even for mobile. in-game sound effects and music are very great, the best i've ever seen. intresting storyline, pretty character design and the greattttest voice acting. if you are choosing to play or not, play, u will not regret:) minuses - economy in game is (welllllll) not so bad, but not so good. very simple to play without donut, but better with it",16,"May 19, 2022",5
"I really, really like this game! It's fun, all the characters are really cool, the storyline is awesome, I like (almost) everything about this game. LiSa kEePs dYiNg lol my reason for four stars is because the controls are a little wonky on mobile. I've fallen off cliffs five times because for some reason my characters go in full circles before actually turning around. But other than that, I love this game and I won't be bored! It's like a mixture between Skyrim and Kingdom Hearts and I love it",1,"June 14, 2022",4
"Can be a bit laggy, but I blame my phone for that more than anything. Graphics and story telling are amazing, and I wish I could download the background music and listen to it everywhere. The open world format is refreshing to have in a mobile game, and navigation through the world is rather easy when you are familiar with open world format. I'm really excited to see what will be done with the game next.",6,"May 31, 2022",4

"Amazing game I love the character design, lore, fighting styles ,wishing, etc. But I did rated a 4 star instead because that on my phone (Samsung galaxy A51) I still don't know if it happens for other phones but when there would be a scene like the stormterror being summoned its always laggy, for context it would glitch and the characters talking is glitched also but on my computer its all fine. If theres any way to fix this please try to. Thank you :)",13,"May 28, 2022",4
"It's great, it has a bit of everything in it. You can style your house(pot), farm, fish, wish for characters, fight, and so much more!! It has the juiciest story line too! <3 Don't worry, you can also play with friends or strangers. Words can say how good this game is, but I can try! This game makes me a simp. 🤯🤯 THE BEST THING IS.. NO ADS!!!! Honestly the download wait is WORTH IT!!",3,"June 25, 2022",5
"I'm having an issue after the recent update. I can't see the message of my friends that they've sent me, but I can see the small red ""!"" notification. When I try to message someone, my message is gone when I try to exit from the chat box",2,"July 19, 2022",5
"This game is surely addictive, and u have to spend money if u want most of the characters. Its definitely hardest game to pull characters. Even if u spend money there is chance that u wont get what you want. Don't download this or else u'll regret",2,"August 11, 2022",4
"In my Opinion the game is amazing, I love the graphtand the storyline too, but leveling up your characters is very hard...you need to play over and over and over so you can level up characters, this game need two things...No.1: more characters you can play with, and No.2 :need character costuming. Overall I really love the game.",3,"April 9, 2022",5
"it's a very good game and I've been playing since 2.3, had a lot of fun so far only issue in my opinion is that the later into the game you get the more difficult it becomes to really stay engaged in the story and find things to do that will really keep you entertained while playing, the only real reason I still stick around in this is for my characters I've gotten which may be the best part of the game. the grind for strong characters.",1,"April 24, 2022",4
"I love this game so much but a have a problem the resin,now that you update 2.8,you add a new hero and upcoming sumeru, to many domain,less resin.Hoyoverse you should change the resin system that's the only problem in this game.Don't worry I change my rating if my problem has been solve.THANK YOU FOR THE HARD WORK:)",0,"July 20, 2022",3
Really beautiful game. The only downside is that you need a highly powerful device run it on Android. My tablet's antutu score is nearly 492000 but still it starts to get warm after 1.5 to 2 hrs of continuous gaming.,0,"August 24, 2022",5
"Everything's amazing except for the enemy drops, it's always delayed and most of the time don't drop anything... And that's on World 8 which supposed to have higher drop rates?",0,"August 11, 2022",5
"Great gameplay, characters, story, art... The only thing would be that it's a bit difficult for free-to-play characters to make a desired team. If there were more opportunities to get primogems, I think the game would be more enjoyable for everyone!",4,"April 2, 2022",4
"This game has beautiful graphics, an indepth storyline and very enjoyable combat mechanics. There is a lot of content to always keep me busy when I want to play games. Building characters and different team compositions is very fun. However, I would like there to be some way to guarantee a good artifact by having some kind of pity system for artifact substats (just like there is for character and weapon banners)",5,"April 6, 2022",4
"The game is great, it's just the amount of farming and greediness of primogems. Everything is a bit complicated at the start, and it's exciting, but it could even take you up to more than a week to grind 1600 primogems or sometimes even less than that, just for 10 spins and a short animation. I'm not surprised that a big game like this has a lot of purchasable in game items for real money. But at least increase primogems by a bit. But still overall the game is good.",11,"June 12, 2022",3
"Better all game and good inspiration of Zelda. my device is capable to run smoothly.since it runs smoothly but create too much of heat ,since I'm just in start menu loading screen it's starts too much of heat in my device since there no background running app .so please consider my problem and since you optimize smoothly it is to be appreciated but also think about heating of mobile devices . You should help as to overcome this problem . other then that it's wonder and amazing good .thanks 😊",49,"June 6, 2022",5
"Overall one of the best games that your able to play on mobile, a open world map with multiple characters to main, once you play it more it gets easy and fun to play!",0,"August 19, 2022",5
"Fun game, I've spent hours playing, and loved the story and awesome visuals, only problem is how much storage space it takes up, and as of the 2.7 update I had to remove alot of apps so I could download the extra 8.1 GB for it which makes me wonder how much is going to be needed for future updates and if my phone is going to be able to keep up.",16,"June 11, 2022",4
"Screw all the one star reviews. The game is amazing in all term I've seen in open world games. The scenery is beautiful and the physical attraction gives you characters of every body type and personality and fighting style. All players only ever care about getting stronger, not about following the storyline or admiring the game, appreciating the time it took to make it. The physics of the hair and dresses/clothing are phenomenal and there are so few bugs. The character stories are moving aswell",14,"July 12, 2022",5
"I'm not one to take interest in mobile games at all, but when genshin impact captured my eye, i certainly like this game, more likely because of the characters and the soundtracks. Everything is beautiful, for a game that's also on mobile it's impressive to see that it's still compatible, pc and ps4 is great to (I play on three). Everything is amazing so far, I do wish that it can add more shortcuts on mobile like it is on pc to make it easier for us mobile players.",2,"April 18, 2022",5
"Overall the best game out there!!!! Beautiful sceneries, superb soundtracks, a well built main story, OP game mechanics, last but not the least open world.... There's gacha system to get your fav characters but saving primos is a bit tough for a F2P.... Also if you've got a good specs device then no prob else you'll be missing out some crystal clear beautiful sceneries.... I would highly recommend this game and see if it's to your taste.",16,"April 26, 2022",5
"REGARDING 2.7 PATCH.. I'm so freaking speechless in the new archon quest, If there are words I can describe the latest patch, It's without a doubt ""overwhelmingly amazing & breathe-taking!"" Great animations - the cutscenes and cinematics, you will really know that the comapny put a lot of effort, hoyoverse are living up to his reputation. Great Story Plot - Unlike those generic MMORPG game, since now and then a lot of plot twists makes me fell in love with the game over and over again.",8,"June 19, 2022",5

"Total embarrassment. I've played every day since launch. I spent hundreds on this game thinking they valued their player base. I was wrong. They couldn't spare to give the players a little more out of appreciation for all the support we gave them. 10 intertwined fates log in event, same rewards as a previous event. Let's not forget they used to give us daily log in bonuses that gave us 300 gems a while back but that mysteriously stopped. I don't feel inclined to spend anymore. Thanks Mihoyo.",0,"August 7, 2022",1

"The game is 10/10 on PC however the mobile version should use some work, It's extremely laggy even with everything at it's lowest settings, my best guess is the character models have too many polygons for a mobile device to render yet I'm not a programmer. I'd suggest to play this on your computer if you have one cause it runs much better on there.",11,"March 29, 2022",2
"The game is amazing with graphics, character variety, and combat mechanics. So much to discover in this massive open world game. Devs are consistently improving in exploration and world expansion, which is nice. However this game lacks quality daily routine content and end game content after you finish all exploration and story quests. Not much to do on a daily basis when u finish. Thus, leaving you to just do small events often, waiting for big updates and events to come every few weeks.",4,"April 1, 2022",5
"A ""Gotcha game"" that is actually worth playing for once. It is possible to get almost everything with a bit of grinding and certain characters are fun to have but are not required. A free and beautiful game with freedom of movement similar to Breath of the Wild. A good game for large phones and tablets and constantly updated however the current file size as of review date is 15gb give or take. I prefer it on pc but it's great for other platforms too!",3,"April 12, 2022",5
"This game is the best game i have ever played. All the characters design are amazing and the story is interesting. Plus, it's an open world where you can explore and have an adventure freely!

"I LOVE this game I've been fixating on it for a few months and my partner bought me a welkin for it too, my only problems is that materials are really hard to get and the game can get a bit repetitive, and the materials you have to get just get harder and harder to achieve. The combat is pretty hard as well and can get overwhelming. It also runs terribly on my phone but slightly better (playable, at least) on my iPad, and flawlessly on my PC. Definitely need good graphics for this. LOVE IT tho<3",62,"April 30, 2022",4
I loved the game but it's a money pit trying to get characters you want. The wishing isnt fair unless your rich. And trying to join co-op with friends with only 3 spots might as well expect to play alone.,1,"July 13, 2022",2
This game is wonderful so far! As a humble traveler i really recommend this game! Although i may have high expectations for now.. i heard the gacha in this game has some troubles but i hope that will improve on the future! Update: although as much as i love this game i cant really view the cutscenes properly cause of the lag and it can be irritating sometimes. It did made a huge improvement at sometimes but i have to lock my screen in order for it to not glitch out.,1,"June 4, 2022",4
"Love the game, definitely one of the best in Play Store but please please please fix the cutscenes. I literally can't watch any because it's having a brain freeze, like why is that even a thing? why do the cutscenes freeze?? I'm pretty sure there are countless others who have writin this similar comment but please just please fix this. It'll definitely make everyone's game play feel more smooth and not like we are all playing on a device that's made of rock or wood.",8,"May 9, 2022",3
"A very good game with high quality and massive, crazy and amazing landscapes, lots of puzzles and a very balanced story, monthly updates, i played it 24/7 till i sadly finished it. Update: It's been around three months that I'm now playing it, there's no endgame content, game forces you to do your daily actions and then you're gone until tomorrow, Events rewards are getting worse and worse and worse, I have to drop my rating by 2 :(",28,"May 31, 2022",3
"The graphics, rich storyline, open-world exploration, and overall experience is great.

"I have heard alot of this game! I really love it if you ask me. But i dont believe this is a problem, i have downloaded the game but when i put the puzzle in his place it says something like ""username or password error"" and when i press the loading screen it says i need to delete more apps.

"I have been noticing ever since the last 2.5 patch update the game is lagging a bit too frequently. I had gotten used to the small stutters and lags honestly, that's something all mobile players have to go through but honestly there's a limit to it. Especially after the fact that it used to run smooth before. It's worse in 2.6 , my phone is overheating, the game is crashing withing mere 30mins of playing. Please fix this.",144,"April 4, 2022",2
"Still a good game, though I only use mobile for purchases and primarily play on PC. I wish the game didn't time-gate as much and expanded the ability to play more at the users own pace, regardless of how fast it slow they'd like to go through content, but understand the game is still in development and this may not be feasible at this time.

"Hello! This game is my favourite game rn!! Before I start though, There's one thing that you should take into consideration before getting Genshin. One of them is how much storage it takes up!! This can't really be changed, but I do think that it's a game you can only really have if you don't have many other apps- (I use a chromebook). Otherine, I think it's RIDICULOUS that this game it free! Definitely reccomend for a great story, similar to an anime but with more control!",1,"June 3, 2022",5

The company's so stingy and it's interesting like really but it feels more like an errand instead of a game. It's creative and it has this potential but the developers are limiting it to just a really small box. Istg 2.8 is trash,3,"July 24, 2022",1
"The game itself would get 5 🌟. Mobile version loses 2 stars for 2 big faults. 1) have to reload if you turn your screen off and then back on.

due to my game experience somehow there's black screen things that appear on my gameplay it appears when I fight swim or move and my surroundings are colorful and filled with glowy things and somehow can't see and sometimes it just go rainbow style it also happens to the characters where there face goes invisible when playing.

I only play on my phone when I'm traveling, but I mostly play on my PC which is a much better experience.

"No cross server data sharing, seriously I hate this type server management. Gameplay is lacking with QOL change, no manual target lock so your targeting enemies will be messed with when there is a lot of enemies surround you.

The gacha system is rather kind too, as it's not too difficult to get whoever you want as long as you save up. The only thing keeping this from being 5 stars is the co-op, as it is quite lacking and leaves a lot to be desired. Otherwise, an incredible game with lots to do.

I spent some money for a few characters I liked but could of had the same amazing gameplay experience without spending a dime. Beware if you have poor impulse control. However there is no pay to win only pay to simp.",1,"May 18, 2022",5
"The game is very fun to play, and when something does go wrong or is an inconvenience, they are very generous and don't make the game a Hassel about whatever is interfering. I highly recommend this game. Even for beginners it's easy to understand, plenty to do freely, and just all out fun, and is continuously growing.",4,"April 18, 2022",5
"Ive been playing for 2 months or so and so far everythings been great, a very open world game with alot of things to do. A quest based gameplay which doesnt force you to do it so its a very 'do-what-you-want-to-do' game which i like. The main story is fluid and is entertaining. The characters have great designs and very exctied for more of them to come. Very excited to where the developers will take the game and i hope its for the better",2,"June 2, 2022",5
"To all of the new players out there wanting to install this GACHA game I could tell you that it is an amazing game with LOTS of grinding and farming. The graphics is good, the characters are good, but some are trash. The storyline is great but I felt so underwhelmed with the recent archon quest. I would totally recommend to NOT spend any money on this game. But it is up to you to spend your entire fortune or not. Overall, it is still a great gacha game,",1,"May 30, 2022",4
"I pretty like this game. The graphics was awesome and the storyline is great, every quest is challenging and fun. This will test your logical and problem solving skill.They are generous with the rewards and won't require you to spend much money which is very considerate. The map is massive and every place is unique, I love how the developers pour their passion and creativity in this game. I hope in my next life I could experience being on the same team developing such awesome software. ❤️",2,"May 31, 2022",5
"I've loved this game for over a year now, I used to play daily. So much drew me in. But the characters designs are getting increasingly predictable, boring and in some cases orientalist or racist. Do better.",0,"August 24, 2022",1
"Fix enkanomiya PLEASE! When I try to do anything in the region, especially combat, the entire screen flashes and stutters multiple times, making the game basically unplayable. This only happens in Enkanomiya for me, and if it's happening to others, this glitching can be dangerous to people who are sensitive to flashing lights! Idk if it's my device or the game, but please fix the lag in the new region.",13,"May 31, 2022",4
I edited this for 5th times now but this game keeps getting better i really love the graphics of this game its very detailed and theres some glitched that makes me laugh at the time fun and sus characters and fun adventure moments with some of the playable characters and non playable characters! So i just wanted to say they should remove the pre install pack because it just wastes more storage.,1,"July 13, 2022",4
"I used to love Genshin but this is getting ridiculous. Pretty much every system in the game needs to change, from money-to-genesis crystal ratio, to earning primogems, to every reward you get ever not being worth anything in the long run, to money being the only way you get what you want in this game. It looks pretty and the gameplay is smooth if you're on a good device with good internet. But the character variety is lacking, only 2 POC characters and decent artifacts are once-in-a-blue moon.",141,"July 4, 2022",1
"Amazing graphics, amazing story, really good customer care, but now the game is beginning to feel repetitive. I have yet to farm a full set of (best possible)artifacts for ANY of my characters despite being at AR55. It's like the game is bugged to give artifacts with bad stats so that people will keep playing. I suggest you either remove this bad RNG for artifacts or remove the resin system, as it's becoming impossible to get the artifacts we want. You do not strive to give the best experience.",128,"June 29, 2022",1
I really like this game. This game has a very engaging story and unique characters. But you need a large storage and compatible phone for the game. AND today it keep crashing after updating the game and i reinstall it 3 times and it's still doesn't work and I also rebooted my phone but the result still the same. Pls help,3,"May 5, 2022",3
"I love everything. But the game is getting more stale by the second that makes me unmotivated to do the newer content. The artifact system is very reliant on RNG even more than characters(weapon banner is worse than artifact tho). I wish the game can give us a choice on what artifact that can drop on a domain. Not like stats, just the type of artifact. For example; I have been farming Itto's artifacts for a long time but I only get Ocean Hued Clam pieces. I have Kokomi and shes fully built.",4,"April 4, 2022",2
Honestly love it. Loved it from the start. I stopped playing because I was so addicted to exploring. I'm back into playing it again because I can control myself now I think haha. If the reason why you play is exploring and the story content you'll never run out of stuff to do. If you're playing to whale and do end game content then you'll run through the game fast. I didn't like leveling my characters in the past and playing boss content but now am enjoying farming things for my characters,78,"March 30, 2022",5
"This is probably the best rpg of its kind your going to find on mobile, graphically and game play wise, in my opinion, at least the best I've found. you can spend a buttload of money on the gambling mechanic rolling for better characters and weapons if you want but you don't need to. I haven't spent anything and have a nice variety of characters and weapons, updates are pretty regular with new content, combat system is interesting, and while I've never used it there is a coop feature as well",6,"June 11, 2022",5
"The game is running smooth it doesn't lag, the graphics is amazing and the CGI makes it realistic. The only problems is when I always encounter the dragon the game glitch and its hard to see what's on the screen. I think the dragon needs more work.",1,"April 30, 2022",4
"Too large, takes up way too much space and constantly fails to update because of it. Worst yet, the updates need new space, so you effectively need double the size of the program at all times so you can update. Probably around 30+ GB? And no, using the SD card gains you nothing. Do yourself a favor and either skip this or just play it on a console or PC.",129,"April 9, 2022",1
"It's a fun game! It's very well made and extremely detailed, and an engaging adventure game, and the most fun I've had in a while. Edit: I have some things to say about the game that kind of ruins the enjoyment: - Grind-y nature: -Fluctuating Writing Quality: -Strange Company to Audience relationship..otherwise, it's still a fun game if you aren't burnt out by the grinding.",21,"April 8, 2022",4
"Personally love, all though I can tell where people are coming from the new puzzles are quite challenging. I honestly love ayato and the new events. So many unique and awesome characters I love the hangouts and such. I wish there were more events that new players could partake in, my friend is new and can't do any of the events and feels he is missing out.",7,"April 12, 2022",4
"It runs smoothly and overall great game, but for some reason on my device, some things are not displayed, like ice on water, damage numbers and the stormterror boss fight. I assume this is an common issue among low-end devices. But please fix this as soon as possible.",3,"June 5, 2022",3
"Im addicted to this game, the story is amazing and even the cut scenes are great, i made friends as well! The stickers and characters are also cute. No ads too! The graphics, character design, weapons, everything was so pretty and adventurous! The characters even have their own stories which makes it fun.",6,"May 13, 2022",5
"One of the best mobile games we've ever had! I can't believe this game is free. Awesome gameplay, beautiful exploration and compelling storyline. The game still has a lot to improve on though—like the horrible rng for artifact's and how limited the endgame content is. But overall, I recommend everyone to play this game if you're looking for an open-world experience.",9,"April 27, 2022",5
"Overwhelmed by the gameplay, it gives a console like feeling with amazing graphics and no ads. The story line is very good and new content seems to be added here and there. It is completely free to play and fair even if you're a free-to-play player. And character customisation is huge!",2,"June 19, 2022",5
"Amazing mobile open world game, engaging story, beautiful and well developed characters, good sound design, and energy/resin based- so you only need to play 20 minutes ish a day. My only gripe is the endgame content since there is no endgame. After building your characters and unlocking their upmost potential, you have nothing to use this on. Very good game overall, its just that the endgame sucks",1,"June 27, 2022",4
"Mostly great game. Graphics, story, gameplay, events, character design are all great. Several problems that I don't think at this point will ever be resolved. I mostly play on pc and the game has a small stutter. I'm on a 3070 and forums basiclly say it's a unity engine thing. Also artifact grinding is 99% of end game. The game needs some sort of end game activity like honkai has. And pc client is still locked at 60 fps. Still a great game, maybe it'll be closer to honkai in terms of qol soon.",3,"July 6, 2022",4
"The graphics look great and the story animation is amazing. I love how we can complete the missions without any difficulty. In my opinion tho, it's nice if we can have the Co-Op mode at level 5 or 10 bcause it takes time to reach 16. People might eager to play with their friends.",1,"June 4, 2022",5
It's good but too demanding even for a upper-mid range phone. And there's occasional glitches in some cutscenes where the audio of the game continues but the scene doesn't. I can barely play it even in the lowest settings and my phone is fairly powerful. Edit: 'Was' powerful.,14,"March 30, 2022",3
It's not a bad game if you get past the bad game mechanics. Like how some characters are adventure rank locked and the energy system to do things is really bad. And some people who play the game. But characters are not to hard to get if you plan out you resources and get them.,4,"July 4, 2022",5
"Great game, the only big flaw with it as far as I can see is the gotcha system. It costs too much to get the characters and weapons, and with the rate they come out at its basically impossible for free to play people to get anything good.",1,"June 23, 2022",4
"They have really good stories that trigger your mind to find solutions, sometimes can get a little laggy when you join another's player world, but it gets back to normal after few minutes. I recommend not to level up in world level until you are fully equipped.",1,"July 12, 2022",5
"This game is very FUN INDEED. But as a starter, I hate the amount of cutscenes that are implemented into this game. I couldn't enjoy much. Anyways, despite being on a new and more better device, this game is quite laggy and crashes sometimes. I have edited this part I just wanted to say my world does not have any grass or any effects like when u hit a monster they don't put the amount of damage or superconduct or immune or anything. Fix this",7,"July 1, 2022",2
"This is by far the best game ever! Its very interesting, full of adventures, quests, and there are even new characters and versions so quickly. This means more quests added and with that its much funner! You get to fight weekly bosses, commissions, Bounties, enter domains, abyss, and earn ez money! The only problem about this game is its storage, whenever updates come, the storage it occupies reaches up to 15+GB sometimes. Although besides that, the game is very addictive and interesting!",3,"July 13, 2022",5
"Dear Developer Game. For the rating of this game itself, it's not too bad, but needs improvement when updating. Pre-download files from games should not pile up with old files, or I should suggest there is some kind of setting what data files we can delete in games, such as sound files. So that later it does not grow and interfere with users. That is all from me ^_^",1,"July 13, 2022",4
I enjoy this game a lot and I love the characters. But recently I have been dealing with a few glitches where my game would freeze or when I close the app there would be a strange sound coming from my phone. I believe that a glitch is behind it and please fix it!,1,"July 13, 2022",5
"I love this game, there are super interesting characters for all playstiles and they're always releasing more. The only problems I've had are with the endgame content (there's not much to do after lvl 50), weapon banner is a terrible thing, and also the resin system is kinda of a problem here",1,"June 27, 2022",4
"Great game, amazing story, graphics etc. I feel like storage wise they could fix something, especially for mobile users. Also, y'all crying about the skin tones are pathetic as heck. Play a different game then, if any of the upcoming characters become poc it's an instant skip.",1,"July 4, 2022",5
"I have been playing for a good 2 years and I loved it at 1st however I cant even get into the game. I understand that this game isnt small but I recently got a new PC and Cromebook, I wanted to play this game on both and when I tried on both devices it said that there wasnt enough storage. It started to load on both but then after it reached 100 it said that my storage was full. I didnt download anything or add anything to either of my devices before I opened the game. I still would like to play",1,"July 10, 2022",2
"It was a great game and after 2.7 update, I felt that the doesn't lag that much anymore, but it only lasted for a few days then it became laggy to play again. It's still playable though. However, when I logged in my account to my laptop and played genshin there, the account installed in my phone doesn't even load. I don't understand why logging my account in my laptop makes the app installed in my phone even more laggy. Please reply or help me resolve this, thank you.",2,"June 16, 2022",2
"I've been playing Genshin Impact for over a year now. Early game, it is very charming and fun. A lot of content, quests, events, and hangouts to do. But when you get to AR 50-ish, things tend to get boring. Things you could do end-game are just new events, dailies, farming domains, and/or coop. Overall, I would rate this game is a 9/10.",4,"July 13, 2022",4
"The game is great, but it gets very boring once you reach a higher ar. It's very repetitive and there is no endgame coming in the near future. Spiral abyss is the only endgame content, but some players are not interested in that. If the new regions are just going to be more exploring and quests then I won't be suprised if genshin will be labeled as a dead game.",34,"July 8, 2022",1
"I cannot play the game!! Two stars because I heard the game is awesome and I've seen gameplays. It astonishes me that this game is free with all the graphics and the story. But, I would love to see that by myself and I can't since, everytime it's done downloading the game and it's about to start, it crashes, and I can't even play it in the end... Talk about gameplay. Please do something about this.",8,"June 30, 2022",2
"The game is great!! The graphics are amazing,the characters are creative.Events are also interesting.Wishing for characters can be exciting but sometimes dissappointing tho- Overall,everything is good!! It may lag on the phone.",1,"July 14, 2022",4
"I have been playing for 6 months as of this review. Pros: 1)Decent story 2)Great music 3)Interesting characters and personalities Cons: 1)Badly designed power creep. Challenging content is great, but the playerbase hates enemies that are way too OP or cheap, e.g. Rifthounds, Specters, and serves more like a DPS check chore, than providing a fun challenge. 2)Lack of manual aim. 3)Lack of a true, enjoyable end-game. Abyss is the endgame we have but there is exponential power creep compared",2,"June 25, 2022",2
"Easily the game of the year! Amazing storyline, fun gameplay, and incredibly beautiful artwork at a free to play price. You'll hear a lot of criticism targeting gacha games, but the truth is you're the player and it's you who decide if you enjoy a casual or competitive pace. Edit: Played from launch and it's still at the top of my list, beating all other mobile games I've tried since",1,"June 14, 2022",5
"The game is excellent Just a small thing I wish devs should do is make a setting where the game does not render all the graphics and just a color or part of the object, something called as potato graphics. This can help reduce cpu usage and would surely help a lot of travellers.",1,"July 6, 2022",5
this is so good! The graphics are great it makes me calm and I love decorating the tea pot but one problem is that it's taking so much storage I think you should add a thing that erases the past events so the storage would lessen a little bit:) but still a five star this is the most awesome game I have ever played ❤️,1,"June 15, 2022",5
I like this game because it is only the game which is the level of anime and not only this they fix their all bugs very faster than other games. The stories of this game is very very unimaginable. I like Yelan's story quest than other .I request to hole genshin impact team to make quest like the yelan's . Some quest are also very nicer than yelan's but there is no voice so because of this the game sometimes gives the odd experience .There is also issue in hud costumisatin for mobile platform.❤️,2,"June 22, 2022",5
"It's a really cool game, the graphics, the game play are also pretty cool especially how it's open world, gives u the chance of exploring and all but I've yet to understand why there are only three characters that are dark skinned and the rest are as pale as paper, and also, the new dedro character literally looks like dendro paimon, i feel like there should be more variety of skin colours in the game rather than just pale and definitely a change on the new archon",4,"July 1, 2022",3
"I havent played the game but based of the fandom I really like it. I need help with something though. When ever it says start I press start and then a loading screen pops up saying ""wear head phones for a better expirience."" I redownloaded it multiple times and I even switched servers. Maybe its because the first time I downloaded it I deleted it cause I thought it took too long to load. Hoyoverse please help me.",1,"July 5, 2022",2
"At first the game is pretty amazing but eventually nearing the endgame it's all about dmg and artifacts it's no longer fun unlike the beginning. It just feels like being forced into the game to do commissions and spend your resin, it's no longer fun not being able to look into things like before.",24,"June 25, 2022",4
Do i even need to say why this game is the best!! Story 10/10 | Music 10+2/10 | Exploring 10/10 | Graphics 10/10 | Story Development 11/10 | Game Mechanism 10/10 | My phone has a Snapdragon 665.I know my phone can't handle something heavy game like this. But i really wanted to try this so I gave it a try.Playing at the lowest setting as possible.I'm just addicted. The music and graphics are too good that sometimes you just stood there and wander to hear the theme song and the beautiful visuals.,1,"July 12, 2022",5
"Overall good game. Spent the last 10hours or so experiencing it without any help or guides and i havent been prompted to spend a dollar. No energy depletion, no paywall (thus far) and overall im thoroughly enjoying the game as it is. There will likely be a paywall towards the later stages but that is acceptable as is with all mmorpgs.",1,"July 4, 2022",5
"I've been playing this for a year now, My only problem when it comes to artifact farming is, It really is disappointing. I've been farming for half a year now and a lot of artifacts doesn't make sense. It really waste my time. Now there's another element leak it will also lessens our probability to get higher stats artifacts. I hope hoyoverse here us out. Cause our main problem is not character wishing. All characters are the special on their own and we can't maximize it. We only have few resin",4,"June 29, 2022",4
"Cant Get It To Download Fully. Beautiful graphics. Seems as if it could be a great game to play. 1 star for not being able to fully download the extremely large ""resources"". After more than half of dl completed, games keeps force closing. Very frustrating. Uninstalling. Hopefully you can get this fixed.",1,"June 26, 2022",2
Ok I know I rated 3 stars but I love this game so much and I play it all the time. There's a couple problems though. 1 why does it take so much space. Like seriously every update takes atleast 1gb 2. Aiming is hard. When you have an arrow character aiming is so hard. 3 wifi. If my internet connection isn't perfect the game is so laggy,10,"June 18, 2022",3
"The game is amazing. Love it. They could fix a few things, Like Character Banners, Resin, The map and other things which they will have issued with in the future but it is still a awese game and I would 100% recommend it.",2,"July 12, 2022",5
"Genshin Impact is amazing, the graphics are nice, and the overall idea of the game is interesting. Although I love the game, I have to say that it's storyline is falling off, this game had been one of my favorites until Inuzuma was unlocked, Inuzuma felt rushed and the events have gotten very boring, the 4 stars of genshin after Inuzuma was released also fell off, the designs of Inuzuma and it's characters are great, but they're boring. Overall though, I really enjoyed this game.",1,"June 21, 2022",3
"Uhh it's kinda boring now. It is a stunning game but there is little to no endgame content and the pity system is extremely unfair and annoying. The game creators have barely any representation of black cultures with characters and designs. Other than a few other problems, the game is a solid rpg/mmo game with fun gameplay, lots of characters and cool characters animations. The lore of the game is very deep and is all explained or yet to be. This is not a grindy game so play once every few days!",2,"July 13, 2022",3
"The game is amazing, music, visuals, and very addicting but the latest updates and the new character kits, rushed archon quests and horrible anniversary + ignorance were really displeasing, I hope the team learned from their mistakes and we don't have anything like that anymore in the future",6,"July 8, 2022",5
"I do enjoy playing Genshin impact but I am having issues with the new update. When I check the events it says that I still need to go to the chasm and unlock a quest to defeat the new boss. I have completed the required Quest and defeated the boss but but when I check events it still hasn't updated itself, even after uninstalling the game and reinstalling it. Please help hoyoverse",5,"July 12, 2022",4
"I love it its very addictive I like how you get to chose between the male or the female twin and the gameplay is awesome too the attacks are cool, I prefer Lumine over Aether because she's underrated. When you unlock statues you can pick between the elements. The game is difficult in ways due to levels of the mobs and yourself that's all bye thank you for reading <3",3,"June 23, 2022",5
